Furthermore, the cross-party Iraq Study Group formed of former senior US political figures officially submitted a report on Iraq on Wednesday to US President Bush and Congress and also put forward ninety-seven recommendations.
The report says that the situation in Iraq is extremely severe and is still deteriorating day by day.
It recommends a major revision of US strategy toward the Iraq war.
At a press conference held on the same day, the members of the group also admitted that although the report provides the US government comprehensive and in-depth recommendations, due to the extremely complicated nature of the situation in Iraq, the report itself is not a cure-all for all problems.
Also, the research group does not propose in the report an actual timetable for troop withdrawal, but it nevertheless recommends that the US military withdraw almost all combat troops before the beginning of 2008.
Furthermore, the task of the troops that stay behind should also be shifted from fighting to support functions.
The report warned the Bush government that it should not make an open-ended commitment to Iraq and urged Bush not to hesitate to use threats as a means to force the Iraqi government to improve the security situation.
