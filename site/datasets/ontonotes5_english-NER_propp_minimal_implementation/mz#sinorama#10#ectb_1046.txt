Cracking Down on Black Gold
-LRB-Teng Sue-fentr. by Christopher MacDonald-RRB-
At the end of December there was an-other piece of good news concerning the new government's crackdown on crime.
Fugitive Huang Wen-chung, wanted for complicity in the slaying of former Kaohsiung County Council speaker Wu Ho-sung, was arrested in Phuket after a two-year investigation and with the cooperation of the Thai police authorities.
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office.
It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics.
Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government's platform.
On December 15 the Ministry of Justice released the results of the first six months of its campaign against black gold-LRB-i.e. collusion among politicians, crime syndicates and big business-RRB-.
In the period up to December 10, prosecutors around Taiwan dealt with more than 2,000 cases concerning black-gold offenses, brought charges against 30 elected officials and representatives, and found over NT$ 2.59 billion in misappropriated public funds.
The following cases, currently under investigation, have attracted particular attention : the alleged involvement of Linkou mayor Tsai Tzung-yi, Yingko Township chief Hsu Yuan-ho and Linkou council deputy chairman Chou Yeh-feng in the operation of an illegal waste dump at a disused brickyard ; alleged fraud by Nantou County commissioner Peng Pai-hsien in connection with construction projects ; allegations of corruption against Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien ; and the suspected embezzlement of post-921 earthquake relief funds by Hsinchu municipal council speaker Cheng Cheng-kuang.
Cases in which charges have already been brought include : the alleged misuse of public funds for overseas trips by Miaoli County commissioner Fu Hsueh-peng, along with county councilors Lo Hsing-chun and Hsieh Ching-chuan ; alleged breaches of the Securities Transaction Law by leading brokerage owner You Hwai-yin ; alleged financial fraud by national legislator Lin Jui-tu ; and alleged corruption by Tainan mayor George Chang in connection with a canal dredging project.
On December 6 the Executive Yuan passed a draft amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall Law, tightening the criteria for those seeking public office so as to prevent mob affiliates from securing legal immunity as elected representatives.
Under the new provisions, anyone convicted and sentenced to jail under the Organized Crime Statute is barred for life from seeking election to an official post, while those indicted for a capital offence or for crimes carrying sentences of ten years or more are barred pending the verdict of the court.
Political parties become liable for the records of their candidates and face fines of NT$ 500,000 to NT$ 5 million if they nominate candidates who have prior convictions for electoral fraud or election violence.
These revisions to the law will immediately affect a number of parliamentary incumbents, including legislators Kuo Ting-tsai and Wu Tze-yuan, both of whom face disqualification from re-election.
The new provisions have received cross-party support in the legislature, though some deputies want further consultation concerning the exclusion from elections of those charged with but not yet convicted of the relevant offences, as this may deprive them unfairly of their rights.
Ho Chih-hui, secretary-general of the KMT caucus in the legislature, says that the party supports barring those convicted of involvement in organized crime from public office, but feels that the Executive Yuan needs to clarify just what " involvement " constitutes in this context.
Also, at the end of December and after much consultation within the opposition alliance, a preliminary agreement was reached on the draft amendment to the Farmers ' and Fishermen's Associations Law, which has been under lengthy review in the legislature.
According to the agreement, restrictions on those seeking association membership and sub-committee posts will be relaxed, but the rules will be tightened for those running for the posts of director or general secretary, excluding or removing from office anyone who is in default for more than a year on loans from these and other such financial organizations.
However, the amendment remains stuck in the legislative queue for the time being.
In addition to the Ministry of Justice, the Criminal Investigation Bureau has also scored some successes in the past few months in its campaign against crime syndicates.
In early November the leader of the Four Seas Gang, Yang Kuang-nan, who had been arrested in Shanghai by mainland authorities, was transferred to Taiwanese custody in the transit lounge at Macau Airport and brought back to Taiwan for questioning.
Yang had fled to the mainland in November 1997, after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with a loan-shark operation, and has been a key target for the police ever since.
Good news has also been coming in from local prosecutors ' offices around Taiwan.
Prosecutors in Taitung have been investigating county councilors for alleged corruption involving public grants and construction projects, and after half a year of the investigation 19 representatives have been indicted, including the current speaker and deputy speaker of the county council, along with 41 members of the previous two sessions of the council.
This sets a judicial record for the number of elected representatives facing charges in a single case.
Meanwhile, prosecutors in Changhua have been investigating electoral fraud from the time of the presidential election, and are seeking sentences of two months to three years for over 200 people, including the head of Yuanlin Township, for breaking the Election and Recall Law.
The Ministry of Justice has achieved a measure of success so far in its crackdown on black gold, but in order to win public support it has had to stress to investigators the need to observe due process and respect suspects ' rights.
The ministry has also required prosecutors to use discretion when collecting evidence about suspected financial impropriety by officials-for which there is a low rate of conviction-so as not to obstruct the work of civil servants or damage their morale.
