I'm David Coler, VOA News.
Florida has announced the official results of last Tuesday's presidential election.
Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris said that out of 6 million votes cast Republican candidate George W. Bush received just 300 votes more than Democratic candidate Al Gore.
Ms. Harris also said that in obedience to a court ruling she will consider amending the results based on hand recounts in three Florida counties.
In accordance with today's court ruling confirming my discretion in these matters, I'm requiring a written statement of the facts and circumstances that would cause these counties to believe that a change should be made before the final certification of the statewide vote.
This written statement is due in our office by 2 p.m. tomorrow.
At stake are Florida's 25 electoral votes.
Whoever wins them will become the next US President.
