In view of the important characteristics of warfare in a modern information rich environment, a training base in the Lanzhou Military Command has taken care to create a complex electromagnetic environment when organizing army exercises, in order to improve through training the military's ability to win battles in an information-rich environment.
During one recently organized exercise, to create the electromagnetic environment for the blue force's command and communication system, they used the method which combines real and simulated set-up, aerial and land-based, fixed and tracking, and real and fake measures.
Using advanced electronic information technology and simulation technology, they produced things like mimic radar communication vehicles and mimic satellites communication vehicles that simulate electromagnetic properties.
They placed actual objects inside the blue force's positions to mimic the electromagnetic environment that various kinds of weaponry would create during a battle.
Through the combined operation of many techniques, they chiefly worked to create a relatively complex electromagnetic battlefield for the army.
Against a complex electromagnetic environment and countermeasures, they guided the army to carry out exercises in electronic reconnaissance and anti-reconnaissance, jamming and anti-jamming, suppression and anti-suppression actions and other operations.
This effectively trained and improved the army's ability to carry out multiple combat operations in an information-rich environment.
