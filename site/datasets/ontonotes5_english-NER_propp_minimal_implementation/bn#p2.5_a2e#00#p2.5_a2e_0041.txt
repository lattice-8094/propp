Welcome.
And we begin our conversation with His Excellency the Ambassador Mr. Nasser.
Your Excellency, I mean, I mean, it is said that it is unprecedented in the history of Lebanon, a crowd of such, uh, enormous size.
The opposition today took to the streets, maybe this was the last option after it, uh, went to the dialogue table later for consultation.
The roads were blocked and they took to the streets.
The goal of the demonstration is change, reform, uh, changing the government.
Will anything actually change in Lebanon after this demonstration, especially since the government is saying that it is staying, staying, staying ?
First, no one called for the government to fall without justification.
the first demands were an agreement to expand the government or modify it so it would become a national unity government.
Um.
His Excellency Speaker Nabih Berri has explained this matter and said, the matter does not depend on the resignation of the government, or changing the prime minister, or a new confidence.
All that there is to it, is that the issue requires, uh, a national consensus during this fateful period in the history of Lebanon.
And when these demands were met uh, with a categorical rejection, they were left with no option.
There was no other way but to take to the street because the basis of democratic rule is that power derives from the people.
Um.
The people are the source of authority, therefore let us seek the people's decision.
That is the issue.
Um.
