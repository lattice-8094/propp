A former FBI informant accused of being a double agent has been indicted.
The charges against Katrina Leung are the latest in an alleged case of sex, spies, and international intrigue.
Charles Feldman is in Los Angeles with details on this one.
Reporter :
This is a story that has made the FBI look--well, kind of dopey.
It has put a spotlight on U.S.China relations.
Like any good spy movie, it's already had a sequel with the first indictment earlier in the week and another one just yesterday.
On Thursday, the other shoe dropped.
Just one day after a former FBI counterintelligence agent was indicted on charges of gross negligence, his mistress of two decades, Katrina Leung, was herself indicted on more serious charges of copying and possessing documents relating to the national security of the United States, documents she allegedly lifted on many occasions from the briefcase of her ex-FBI handler, James Smith.
Leung's lawyers wasted little time responding to the grand jury indictment.
Katrina Leung is no Mata Hari, as people have suggested.
She was recruited actively by the FBI because of what she could do and because of what she knew.
She did not go out to get this job.
Reporter :
Leung, a prominent Chinese-American, was practically the toast of L.A.
She was seemingly present for just about every event involving local politicians, sometimes national ones, and various high-ranking officials of the Chinese government.
That part, at least, was by design.
Leung was hired by the FBI and paid almost $ 2 million over 20 years to spy on the Chinese.
Federal prosecutors now say she pulled a fast one and actually spied on the U.S. for the Chinese.
This case is a major embarrassment.
