A second round of Israeli-Palestinian talks ended Saturday night with no breakthrough but the two sides have agreed to keep talking.
Led by former Israeli Prime Minister Shimone Peres and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the two delegations met for more than two hours.
They are trying to narrow their differences over a US framework for negotiating a final peace agreement.
