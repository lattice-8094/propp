President Clinton is going prime time tonight to bid farewell to Americans in a televised address.
The speech is being billed as a thank-you to the people who twice voted him into the White House and supported him even at his lowest moments.
Yesterday, Mr. Clinton spoke to supporters in his home state of Arkansas.
It was the last of several speeches he has made in recent weeks to his backers across the country.
