The Israeli and Palestinian leaders have spoken by telephone in a new effort to try to stem the ongoing violence in the Middle East.
Israel says the two leaders agree to maintain limited security cooperation.
The phone call took place while the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was holding talks in Moscow with the President Putin.
Nick Childs reports.
The telephone call between the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat represents another faint glimmer of hope that the two sides may be able to rein in the latest cycle of violence between them.
According to Mr. Barak's office they 've agreed to maintain a measure of security cooperation, which had been on the verge of complete breakdown.
A phone call also represents something of a coup for Russia, which is anxious to boost its Middle East role.
It was apparently engineered by President Vladimir Putin during his talks with Mr. Arafat.
