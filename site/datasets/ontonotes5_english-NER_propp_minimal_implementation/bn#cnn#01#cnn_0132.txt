Senator Barbara Boxer of California is in Florida to support the undervote recount.
She says on Election Day, exit polls in the state indicated voters chose Al Gore, and now it's time to see if that's true, but not everyone appreciated what she had to say.
I have something I want to say to the Bush people, and that is, if they were up here speaking, I would not boo them, and I also wanted to mention to them that I come from the state that elected Ronald Reagan, who they revere, and also those same people elected me, so I hope that they would have the decency to allow me to speak.
