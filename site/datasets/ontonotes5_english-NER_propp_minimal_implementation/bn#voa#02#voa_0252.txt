Before breaking for dinner delegates held two sessions lasting eight hours.
The mood here continues to be pessimistic, but relations between the two sides appear cordial and by Monday afternoon most delegates had dafted their coats and ties for more casual clothes.
Palestinian Parliament speaker Ahmed Kurai indicated however, an agreement is still not assured.
I can say that there are very serious discussions on issues which represent the keys of the agreement are in discussions.
There are still a gap, but we are working very seriously to see whether it's possible.
Mr. Kurai said the topics under discussion include the issues of territory, Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
The talks began Sunday night.
Officials said they would meet for up to ten days in the hopes of forging agreement on at least some outstanding issues before Israel's prime ministerial election in two weeks.
