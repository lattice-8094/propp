Clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops have followed Friday prayers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even as leaders of the two sides take steps to end five weeks of violence.
In Friday's violence, two Palestinians were killed by gunfire in the West Bank and a number were wounded in other clashes.
The top advisor to Israel's Prime Minister acknowledged that the Palestinian Authority is making efforts to implement a truce even as attacks against Israeli forces continued.
