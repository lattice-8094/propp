Recently, er, Interpol, ah, has been focusing a lot of attention on, ah, this affair of North Korea, er, counterfeiting currency.
Well, they say, er, that North Korea, er, is now producing on a large scale, this, a kind of bill with a face value of 100 US dollars, which is called a super fake note.
The so-called super fake note means it has an extremely high accuracy in copying.
We can have a look.
At the top is a real note and at the bottom is a fake note.
But with a naked eye like ours, %pw, it is at this distance we ca n't see that there's any difference.
In a word, this kind of fake note, uh, really is %pw, extremely accomplished.
Normal people, uh, could hardly tell the difference.
So, now, er, the US Treasury Department has brought out an announcement, saying that ah, the fake notes, ah, produced by North Korea, um, were actually produced and circulated with the agreement of the government, and under the management and control of the government.
So, they have so far, er, discovered in total that North Korea has made at least 50 million US dollars of this kind of, fake, um, US currency.
Um, in fact, er, this time of last year, the US government had put Banco Delta Asia of Macau, suspected of laundering money for North Korea, on a black list.
It was because of this affair, uh, that North Korea at that time boycotted the six-party talks for one year.
