A senior Israeli official has concluded talks in Washington with President Clinton.
Prime Minister Barak's Chief of Staff Giliad Share has delivered Israel's response to American peace proposals, but at home Barak might face a devastating defeat in the forthcoming elections.
Paul Adams reports.
Israel's Prime Minister is in trouble.
His efforts to reach a comprehensive peace agreement with the Palestinians have so far yielded nothing.
Now with less than 5 weeks to go before elections, the latest opinion poll suggests he is in for a drubbing at the hands of his right wing challenger Ariel Sharon.
For the first time Mr. Sharon has topped 50 % with Mr. Barak trailing by as much as 28 points.
Israel's political commentators are unanimous.
In the words of one of the best, `` The Prime Minister's situation is nearly terminal. ''
Mr. Barak is trying to sell an historic peace agreement to a public that would n't even buy a used car from him.
