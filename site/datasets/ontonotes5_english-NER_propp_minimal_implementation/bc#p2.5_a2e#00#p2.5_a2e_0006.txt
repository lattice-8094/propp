Following the loss of the Republican Party led by US President George Bush in the midterm congressional elections, which were considered a referendum on US involvement in Iraq, came the Study Group report on US policy options in Iraq, which is co-chaired by former Secretary of State James Baker, a Republican, and former Congressman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat.
It is assumed that this report, drawn up by the group composed of five Democrats and five Republicans, will serve as a political cover for US President George Bush to reconsider his policy in Iraq at a time when security chaos is on the rise in the country.
Although the group's work was entirely confidential, leaks published by the New York Times newspaper said that the group agreed on the need for a regional conference including Iraq's neighboring countries to discuss means of putting an end to the violence in the country. As well as to urge Bush to abandon his reservations regarding talks with Iran and Syria, who neighbor this country.
Despite the group's division on the issue of setting a timetable for the withdrawal of US occupation forces from Iraq, Democrat Senator Jack Reed expressed his belief that the group may reach an agreement to provide general recommendations rather than specific ones in this regard.
The New York Times said that the group defined its mission as providing the US government with proposed solutions to the Iraqi situation.
