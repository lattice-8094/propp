Former NFL star Dan Marino is presiding as the grand marshal of the annual New York Columbus Day parade.
Marino is leading a star-studded political cast, including Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former presidential candidate John M Cain.
U.S. Senate hopefuls Rick Lazio and Hillary Clinton are marching, too.
The parade route was altered this year to avoid disturbing worshipers at a Jewish temple during the observance of Yom Kippur.
