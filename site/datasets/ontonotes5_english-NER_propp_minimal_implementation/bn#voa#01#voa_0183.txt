I am Dave Deforest, VOA News.
President Clinton has given Israeli and Palestinian delegates some new proposals that could still open the way to a peace agreement before he leaves office January 20th.
The White House meeting capped a week of closed door Middle East talks in Washington.
VOA's David Gallust has more.
The White House says the proposals deal with both the substance and procedure for a peace accord and the signs are to report back next week on whether there are grounds to try to conclude an agreement.
A Clinton spokesman described the week of US mediated talks as constructive, but the parties had differing assessments with Palestinian negotiator Sayeb Erekat saying major gaps remain.
It's been difficult.
The gaps are there.
We exerted maximum efforts and we 'll continue to exert maximum efforts in order to conclude an agreement.
For his part, Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami seemed more optimistic.
Inevitably differences remain, but I feel that it was a very encouraging round of talks.
Mr. Ben-Ami said the next step might be separate Washington visits by Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
US officials say a three-way summit would happen only if an agreement was in hand.
