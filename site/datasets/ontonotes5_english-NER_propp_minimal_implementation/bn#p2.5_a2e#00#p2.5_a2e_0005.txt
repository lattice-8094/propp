Rafael Correa is the new President of Ecuador.
This has become almost certain, even before the release of the official results of the second round of presidential elections which this country, located on the western side of South America, has witnessed.
The difference in the announced numbers between what the leftist candidate, Correa, and his competitor, billionaire Alvaro Noboa, have achieved is so great, it is hard for any expected change to occur in the early announcement of the results, according to voter surveys.
Observers do not expect the predictions of Noboa, who fought his third presidential battle armed with money, to come true : that a civil war would erupt if his forty-three-year-old rival, Correa, won.
This choice of the Ecuadorian voters reflects great hopes on one hand for political stability for the country, for which eight Presidents of the Republic have alternated since the year 1996.
Three of them were forced to resign under the pressure of public demonstrations.
Secondly, Ecuador, with its thirteen-and-a-half million residents, is left with the paradox that three quarters of those live in a state of poverty, though it is an oil producing country.
Thirdly, in getting out of the orbit of the political influence of the United States, which owns a military base in it, Correa has promised to remove it unless Washington accepts Ecuador having a military base on its land.
