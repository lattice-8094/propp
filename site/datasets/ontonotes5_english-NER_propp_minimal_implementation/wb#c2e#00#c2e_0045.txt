No Soap in the Morning.
Michael Zhou
Every morning when we wash face for Yaya-LRB-especially when kid's mother does that-RRB-, Yaya would remind us not to use any face wash.
The little one has always remembered what I once said about a TV program, which documented people going to Tibet.
They would n't wash their faces in the morning in order to retain the grease that coped with the strong sunlight and ultraviolet radiation and would only wash off the dusts with soap at night.
