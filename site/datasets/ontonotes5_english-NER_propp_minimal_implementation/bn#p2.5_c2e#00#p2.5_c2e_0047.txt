Pope Benedict XVI and Orthodox spiritual leader Bartholomew signed a joint statement on Thursday that said the rights of ethnic minorities and groups must be protected as the European Union expands.
It also said that if the European Union protects religious freedom, it will support Turkey's entry into the European Union.
In the joint declaration issued after a prayer ceremony held in Istanbul, Pope Benedict and Bartholomew rejected the concept that massacres could be carried out in God's name, denounced terrorism and iterated that Roman Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox Church would strive for peace and unity while condemning violence.
Such kind of declarations are normally related to theological issues.
However, in this joint declaration made on this occasion, the two religious leaders mentioned negotiations over Turkey's entry into the European Union.
The two spiritual leaders expressed optimism regarding the European Union.
EU members should fully consider all factors that influence basic human rights, in particular freedom of religion, and bear witness to and protect respect for other freedoms.
In the process of world unification, the rights of minority groups must be protected, for example, their cultural traditions and religions.
The European Union has asked Turkey to assure the religious freedom of the country's non-Muslim minorities.
This implies according them the right to own property and authorizing them to open their own schools.
Turkey currently has 120,000 Christians and approximately thirty-thousand Catholics, but one century ago there were two million followers.
The declaration also asks Europe to definitely protect other religions and cultures while maintaining its own Christian culture.
