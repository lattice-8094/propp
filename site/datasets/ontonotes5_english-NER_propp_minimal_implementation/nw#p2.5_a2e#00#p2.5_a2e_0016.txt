The Palestinian Minister of the Environment Youssef Abu Saabi today, Wednesday, accused Israel of using " banned chemical weapons " and " enriched uranium " in Palestinian lands, at the Arab Ministers of the Environment Conference in Algeria.
The minister told reporters that the lab tests conducted outside Palestine proved that Israel had used prohibited chemical weapons and enriched uranium in Palestinian lands.
The minister accused Israel of " transporting large quantities of dangerous chemicals into Palestinian lands, which resulted in pollution of underground water. "
He confirmed that " destruction of the environment by the occupation forces is continuing. "
He mentioned, based on statistics of the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture and the Environment, that " the Israelis have pulled out two million trees in the last six years, half a million of which were olive trees. "
Israel refuses to allow the United Nations Environmental Program and the International Atomic Energy Agency to enter Palestinian lands to investigate this situation.
He said that " the situation in the-LRB-Palestinian-RRB-territories has deteriorated after the construction of the separation wall, following the destruction of a large number of wells, and because of the substantial damage to plants and environmental diversity in the Palestinian territories where 3,500 types of plants and animals have been recorded. "
The 18th round of the Arab Ministers of the Environment is expected to end today, Wednesday.
