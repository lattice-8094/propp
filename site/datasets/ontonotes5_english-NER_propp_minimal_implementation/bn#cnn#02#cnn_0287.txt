Good evening.
Coalition forces in Baghdad have arrested the Palestinian terrorist who led the hijacking of the Italian cruise ship the Achille Lauro in 1985.
During that hijacking the terrorists shot and killed a disabled American, Leon Klinghoffer, as he sat in his wheelchair.
They threw his body overboard.
