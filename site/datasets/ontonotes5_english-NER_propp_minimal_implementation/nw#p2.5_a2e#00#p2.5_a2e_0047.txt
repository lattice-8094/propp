The Indonesian Information Minister, Sofyan Djalil, declared today, Saturday, that the Indonesian government had offered cash compensation to rebels in the Aceh province to help them start a new life after being involved in the rebellion.
Djalil said that concerning former combatants, the government had allocated 25 million rupiahs-LRB-2500 dollars-RRB-per person for former combatants, which is considered to be a huge sum by local standards, and 10 million rupiahs for non-combatants.
He added that there were around 3000 former combatants and over 6000 non-combatants.
Djalil said in an exclusive statement to Xinhua, " The whole matter has been studied and all the money has been sent to Aceh ".
Djalil said that the compensation was offered after a member of the separatist Free Aceh Movement rejected the government's offer of land " because they do n't want land and so chose cash ".
The minister said that the government had allocated over 600 billion rupiahs-LRB-60 million dollars-RRB-from its 2006 state budget for this demand.
On the other hand, in the Aceh province, the spokesman for the rebels, Baktiar Abdullah, said the money was still being distributed and that former rebels had not yet received it.
The separatist Free Aceh Movement has fought for an independent state since 1976 but relinquished its aim for independence after reaching a peace agreement in August 2005.
