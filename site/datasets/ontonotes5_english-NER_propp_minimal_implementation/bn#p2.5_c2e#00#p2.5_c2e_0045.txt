Recently the issue of how to deal with the deposits for public transport cards in Shanghai has attracted widespread public attention.
Today, Shanghai Public Transport Card Company and the regulatory body for the industry, Shanghai Municipal Construction and Transport Commission, made a formal statement on the affair of the transit card deposits that they would conduct an audit on the issue of transit card deposits and would make the results of the audit public.
Previously, the Shanghai Public Transportation Card Co., Ltd had made an announcement saying that their original setting of the deposit at 30 yuan for each card was based on the market price of similar cards at that time.
For example, the deposit for Hong Kong's Octopus Card was 50 HK dollars.
The number of comprehensive transport cards currently in circulation is about 12 million.
The cost of each card is about 20 yuan.
The excess part, after deducting the cost of the card, is deposited into a bank at savings deposit interest rate.
The added-value part is mainly used for the investments, such as in operating the system and improving the service facilities for city residents and others.
But the announcement did not yet elaborate on the list of specific expenditures for the added-value part of the deposits nor on whether or not it would adjust the deposit amount.
In response, the Shanghai Municipal Consumer Rights Protection Commission said that the uses of the comprehensive transport card deposit and the interest it earned should be clearly announced to the public.
And, according to the relevant State Council regulations, the amount of the comprehensive transport card deposit should be reduced.
