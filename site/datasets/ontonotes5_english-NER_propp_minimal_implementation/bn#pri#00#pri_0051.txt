Eight more people were killed today in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, four Palestinians and four Israelis.
A Palestinian ambush on an Israeli settler convoy is the latest escalation in nearly seven weeks of conflict.
NPR's Jennifer Laden reports.
The convoy was travelling near the West Bank city of Ramallah on a stretch of road controlled by the Israeli military.
The Israeli spokesman said there were two simultaneous attacks at an intersection.
A witness described a civilian car and Israeli Army bus riddled with dozens of bullets.
The attack is the latest sign of a shift in the Palestinian uprising from daytime demonstrations by stone throwing youth to nighttime guerilla-style action.
An Israeli government spokesman calls it warfare and Army officials warned they will stiffen their response further.
The attacks were largely carried out by Yasser Arafat's police and security organizations.
They have received weapons from Israel under past peace accords.
