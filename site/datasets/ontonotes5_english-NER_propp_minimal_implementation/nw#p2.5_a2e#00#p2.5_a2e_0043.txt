Bulgarian Defense Minister Vesselin Bliznakov declared today, Monday, his country's readiness to extend its mission's stay in Iraq beyond March 2007, the specified date for its deployment to end, if it received a new invitation from the United States.
Bliznakov said at a press conference immediately on his return from Iraq at the weekend, " We can not settle the question of extending our involvement there on our own, although we are prepared-LRB-to remain in Iraq-RRB-".
The minister said that a new invitation from the United States was required for Bulgarian troops to stay in Iraq.
He added, " We may receive such an invitation early next year ".
He said a careful analysis of the possibility of Bulgaria remaining would be made should such an invitation be received, and he did not rule out the possibility of moving Bulgarian forces to another place.
Bulgaria had withdrawn around 450 soldiers from Iraq on December 30, 2005 after a mission lasting 29 months.
In accordance with a parliamentary decision issued last March, Bulgaria will continue to maintain a unit of 153 non-combat troops to guard the Al-Ashraf refugee camp near Baghdad.
Around 19 Bulgarians, including civilians, have died in the war in Iraq over the past three years.
