Former President Clinton drew cheers from admirers at a US Air Force base outside Washington today before departing for his home in New York, and although Mr. Clinton is out of office, he says he 'll still be around.
So you see that sign there says, `` Please do n't go ''.
I left the White House, but I'm still here.
Go anywhere.
Prior to leaving office today Mr. Clinton issued more than one hundred presidential pardons.
Among those pardoned was Susan Mcdoogle, a former business partner of Mr. Clinton who became a key figure in the White Water Real Estate investigation that plagued the Clinton presidency.
