President Clinton leaves for East Asia today to attend the annual Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Summit, held this year in Brunei.
The meeting of leaders from the 21 Pacific Rim countries is expected to be the last major international conference and last overseas trip for Mr. Clinton as the US President.
He will hold separate sideline meetings of the summit with a number of leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, China's Jiang Zemin, South Korea's Kim Dae-jung, and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
On Friday, Mr. Clinton will travel to Vietnam to become the first US President to visit that country since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.
