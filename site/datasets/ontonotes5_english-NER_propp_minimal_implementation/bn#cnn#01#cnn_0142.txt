Russian President Vladimir Putin is visiting Havana for talks with Cuban President Fidel Castro.
Putin is the first Russian President to visit Cuba since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Castro greeted the Russian leader when he arrived late last night.
Both Russia and Cuba want to renew their decades-old relationship that cooled after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The leaders will discuss trade and other issues, including Cuba's $ 11 billion Soviet-era debt.
