On the 5th, Italian inspection bodies in Milan formally indicted more than 20 American undercover agents to the court.
The reason was that they were suspected of being involved in illegally kidnapping a terrorist suspect in Milan in 2003.
Inspection personnel had requested the extradition of these undercover agents to Italy to stand trial.
According to Italian inspection personnel, on February 17 2003, with the assistance of six Italian special agents, American CIA special agents kidnapped Egyptian-born terrorist suspect Abu Omar in Milan, and brought him to Egypt for trial, so as to avoid execution of normal judicial investigation and extradition procedures.
Omar later said that he received severe torture from Egyptian intelligence agents.
The exposure of this incident at one point placed the Berlusconi government in an embarrassing situation.
After over two years of investigation, Italian inspection personnel believed that a total of six Italians and 26 Americans--among whom, 22 were CIA agents--were involved in this illegal kidnapping case.
They believed that the actions of the U.S. special agents in Italy had badly violated Italian sovereignty.
Currently, six Italians who were involved in the case, including Nicolo, who was in charge of the Italian Foreign Intelligence Agency, have been arrested.
The Italian judge also issued arrest warrants for the 26 Americans who were involved in the case.
