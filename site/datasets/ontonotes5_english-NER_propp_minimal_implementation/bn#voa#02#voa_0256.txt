Thank you very much Tony.
Israeli-Palestinian talks are set to resume today in Taba Egypt.
Israel suspended the talks Tuesday to protest the murders of two Israeli citizens by Palestinian gunmen in the West Bank, but Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his senior ministers decided on the resumption during a Wednesday conference at Mr. Barak's residence in Jerusalem.
