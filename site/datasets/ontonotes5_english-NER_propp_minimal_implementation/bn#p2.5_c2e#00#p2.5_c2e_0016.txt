Representatives from the 11 member states of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC were scheduled to convene a ministerial conference today in the Nigerian capital of Abuja.
One of the main topics at this conference is whether they should continue to reduce production.
However, just the day before the conference convened, various member states were still divided on this issue.
OPEC President on duty and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources of Nigeria Daukoru said on the 13th that this conference would determine the OPEC crude oil production policy for the next stage.
OPEC may decide to continue reducing production, but the rate of reduction will depend on oil prices and levels of inventories.
Daukoru said that OPEC will try its best to maintain stability in oil production so as to balance the relationship between oil supply and demand.
Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC oil producing country, has always voted in favor of production reduction.
However, Libya, Kuwait, and other member states believe that the current international oil price has been stabilized at above 60 US dollars per barrel, approaching the balance of market supply and demand.
Under such circumstances, there is no need for OPEC to continue reducing production.
In October of this year, in response to the prospect of continuous decline in international oil prices, OPEC held a special ministerial conference and decided to reduce daily oil output by 1.2 million barrels starting from November 1.
However, after the decision was announced, it did not produce any significant effect on boosting oil prices, so there was soon word from OPEC that it would continue discussing production reduction.
