Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is rejecting calls for a quick settlement with Palestinians to end the outbreak of violence in the Middle East.
During a meeting of his cabinet, Barak criticized members of his own political party who have urged him to finalize an agreement before President Clinton leaves office next month.
He declared that any attempt to `` dictate dates '' is `` bad for Israel. ''
