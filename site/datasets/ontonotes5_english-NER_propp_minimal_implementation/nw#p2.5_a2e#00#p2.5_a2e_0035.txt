Khamenei calls for people to go to the ballots in the elections for municipal councils and councils of experts
Iranian reformists and conservatives see the Tehran municipal elections tomorrow, Friday, as a key to their victory in the forthcoming general and presidential elections, noting that the results are related to the number of voters.
The Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has urged citizens to go in large numbers to the ballot boxes.
This coincided with the postponement of talks relating to sanctions being imposed on Iran following Russia's dissatisfaction with the situation in Belarus at the Security Council.
Khamenei called on Iranian voters to go to the ballot boxes in great numbers and with " great determination and enthusiasm " to elect members of the municipal councils and the council of experts to " prove to the world Iran's honorable position in this new revolutionary challenge ".
He stressed the importance of the council of experts which is charged with selecting the Supreme Leader and supervising his activities, and called on his fellow citizens to " vote for honorable candidates worthy of trust and with honest intentions ".
The percentage of voters in the previous council elections was among the lowest compared to other elections.
Commentators see the secrecy surrounding the meetings of this body as damaging to its popularity.
