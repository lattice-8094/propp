Rome, 12-2-LRB-AFP-RRB--Title holder Inter Milan continued its advance and positive results and achieved its 11th win against its guest Siena, 2-0 today, Saturday, in the opening of the 14th round of the Italian soccer series.
Inter Milan achieved its 7th successive win in the series and its 11th in various tournaments since October 25-LRB-7 in the series, 2 in the European Champions series, and 2 in the Italy Cup-RRB-.
Inter Milan has not suffered a single defeat in the local championship since the beginning of the season-LRB-11 wins and 3 ties-RRB-after it was given the title following its revocation from Juventus, which dropped to second place when a number of points were transferred from its total to its neighbor Milan, the runner-up, because of their involvement in the score-tampering scandal.
The Argentinian Nicolas Burdisso opened the scoring with a header of a corner kick-LRB-11-RRB-, and his compatriot Hernan Crespo added the second goal, lifting the ball over the goalie and into the net-LRB-54-RRB-.
Later, Roma 2 plays with Atalanta Bergamo and the round concludes tomorrow Sunday with 8 matches.
