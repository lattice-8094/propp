While welcoming Nicholas McInnes's Sept. 18 letter offering corrections to your `` World-Wide Tax Revolution '' table-LRB-editorial page, Aug. 29-RRB-, I am surprised that he neglected other errors that, for some of us, strike close to home.
As a Channel Islander, I was amazed to see my birthplace listed as one of `` 86 countries with an income tax. ''
Despite a history of heated local debate on the topic, my passport clearly reads `` British citizen. ''
Whether Mr. McInnes's oversight is merely a sign of a mainlander's benign neglect is a question my fellow Channel Islanders-LRB-and friends on the Isle of Man-RRB-will continue to ponder.
