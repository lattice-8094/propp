And I really missed people %um from Poland because it was all my support system.
Coming here the only person that really knew and understood my circumstances was Tom.

I still,
all I want to do is sleep now.
I 've been trying to nap for the longest time today.
Every time I lay down a phone rings and like random people call me.

I went to this conference in the U S
and they 're like where did you get that
Great. I'm like %uh that's a really long story.
See there was this volunteer
and she used to know this old man because she used to work
and this man would just sit there and say all right.
I have another one though too
and Tom was really getting sick of it.
What was it ?
.
I 'll have to think of it.

Well Jody might have a job offer in Budapest.
oh that's right.
She was looking at that.
Is n't that crazy ?
