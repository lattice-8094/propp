The Cypriot government today, Monday, blamed " Ankara's negative position " for the failure of the last-minute discussions that took place in Finland with the purpose of avoiding a crisis between the European Union and Ankara over the divided island of Cyprus.
Cypriot Foreign Minister George Lillikas said in a written statement : " Unfortunately, and in spite of our good intentions and the good efforts of the Finnish Presidency, it was not possible to reach an agreement because, as is the case with any agreement, it requires the good intentions of all the concerned parties. "
Lillikas and his Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul held separate discussions in Tampere, Finland, with their Finnish counterpart Erkki Tuomioja prior to the summit of European foreign ministers and Mediterranean Basin countries-LRB-EuroMed-RRB-.
Following the discussions, the Finnish Foreign Minister Tuomioja announced that the discussions had failed.
The Minister, whose country currently holds the presidency of the European Union, said to reporters : " It was not possible to reach an agreement. "
At the end of September, Finland presented a plan to resume direct trading between the European Union and the Turkish Cypriot community in the north of the island in exchange for Turkey's consent to open its ports and airports to Greek Cypriot ships and planes.
In July 2005, Turkey had signed a protocol expanding its customs union with the European Union to include the ten countries that joined the Union in 2004.
However, Ankara refuses to apply this protocol to the Republic of Cyprus, demanding as a prior condition the lifting of the ban imposed on the " Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " which is recognized only by Turkey.
The Finns gave Ankara until the 6th of next December to open its ports and airports to Cyprus, otherwise the Union would discuss the possibility of freezing, at least partially, its membership negotiations that began in October 2005.
