The United Nations climate change conference in the Hague has ended in an impasse after two weeks of intense negotiations.
Delegates from 180 countries were unable to agree on how to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which many believe causes global warming.
Lisa Schline has been monitoring developments from the United Nations headquarters in Geneva.
The delegates were close to an agreement, but in the end a feud between the European Union and the United States caused its unravel.
They disagreed over how targeted cuts in greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved.
Under the Kyoto Protocol, 38 developed countries have to reduce emissions by more than 5 % over the next 10 years.
The United States, which is the world's biggest polluter, wants to reach its target in large part by counting so-called carbon sinks against its emissions quota.
The United States argued that it has many rich forests and will plant new trees to help absorb carbon from the atmosphere as a means of cutting its emissions.
The EU rejected this proposal as self-serving.
Environmentalists have reacted to the failure with dismay.
