Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Spilianovich says his country must negotiate with the UN War Crimes Tribunal before former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic can be prosecuted.
Mr. Spilianovich spoke to reporters Friday during a visit to Washington.
He proposed negotiations to determine whether Mr. Milosevic should be tried in the Hague or in Yugoslavia.
