216 sailors from the `` USS Cole '' are back in their home port of Norfolk, Virginia.
Cheering family members greeted the crew with flowers and waving flags yesterday.
A few `` Cole '' crew members are staying with the ship.
It will begin its five-week trip home on the deck of the rescue ship `` Blue Marlin '' today.
17 crew members were killed and 39 injured in last month's apparent terrorist bombing of the warship.
