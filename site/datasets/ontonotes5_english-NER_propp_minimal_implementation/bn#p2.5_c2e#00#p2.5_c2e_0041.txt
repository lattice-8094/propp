At 7:00AM of local time on the sixth, 8:00PM of Beijing time on the same day, the USA's Iraq Study Group submitted to President Bush a policy report on Iraq which has been brewing for as long as six months.
According to this report, it suggested that the US conduct a staged withdrawal of troops from Iraq and requests that the US hold direct dialogues with Iran and Syria.
Early in the morning on the sixth, the members of the Iraq Study Group arrived at the White House and intended to submit the policy report on Iraq to President Bush.
According to the report of the Associated Press, this report appeals to the US government to adjust its policy on Iraq and suggests that US forces gradually hand security control over to the Iraqi military, then finally withdraw from Iraq in early 2008.
At the same time, the report also suggests that the White House open direct dialogue with Iran and Syria, which have a certain amount of influence on Iraq, and jointly resolve the Iraq problem.
Due to the ever-increasing frequency of violent activity in Iraq recently, the number of casualties among US troops stationed in Iraq has steadily climbed up and the Republican Party where Bush is had a defeat in midterm elections in early November, so how the Bush administration will actually adjust the policy on Iraq has become the focus of attention from all sides in the US.
But White House spokesman Snow points out that the Bush administration actually does not expect too much from this report because it is not fair to have such an idea to expect that this report will provide a magic bullet for solving the Iraq problem.
Additionally, Iraqis are also paying close attention to the arrival of this report.
