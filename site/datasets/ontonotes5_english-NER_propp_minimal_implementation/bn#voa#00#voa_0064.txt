President Clinton has signed into law a bill allowing US exports of food and medicine to Cuba.
Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton says he is not satisfied with the measure.
It purports to allow the export of American products to Cuba, yet it makes it virtually impossible for family farmers to arrange the financing that enables such sales to take place.
The new law bars the US government and US banks from providing funds for such exports at the insistence of Cuba's congressional critics.
The law also prevents Mr. Clinton or his successor from easing restrictions on travel to the Communist country.
