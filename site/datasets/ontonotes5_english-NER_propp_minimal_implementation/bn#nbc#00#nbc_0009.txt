Recapping the developments of this disturbing day in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula--at least six American sailors are dead, 11 still missing and 35 injured after what intelligence experts say was a well-planned terrorist bombing that ripped a 20 x 40-foot hole in the Navy destroyer `` USS Cole '' in the Yemeni port of Aden.
The ship was there for refueling.
President Clinton, vowing retaliation.
