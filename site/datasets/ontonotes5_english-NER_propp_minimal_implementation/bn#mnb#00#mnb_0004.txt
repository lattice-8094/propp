For a late update, live from the campaign trail we 're joined by NBC News correspondent Campbell Brown Ho who's traveling with the Bush effort, and NBC News correspondent Chip Reid traveling with the Gore campaign in Kansas City Missouri.
Good evening to you.
Good evening, Brian.
Well, Bush ended the day with a big rally here.
We 're just outside of Tampa.
And I 'll tell you, these evening rallies really have the feel of a rock concert, or maybe a pro wrestling match.
You have strobe lights, you have screaming crowds, all designed to make Bush look like a winner.
But he is not a winner yet in Florida.
There is one new poll out that actually puts Gore ahead here.
There are still several polls that say Bush is still ahead in Florida.
Bottom line, as we heard David Gregory report, this is not the position the campaign wanted to be in at this stage of the game.
Bush's central message on this bus trip across central Florida today was to his diehard supporters telling them go out, tell your friends still on the fence why they need to vote for me, and it's a message the campaign hopes it was able to convey today, because while Florida is a must-win, they also can not ignore the other battleground states.
Brian tomorrow morning, Bush flies to Pennsylvania, another swing state with 2023 electoral votes, just two less than Florida.
Pennsylvania traditionally, a Democratic state, but one where there's a popular Republican governor, Tom Ridge, and there's a lot of pressure on Ridge right now to deliver Pennsylvania.
He 'll end up tomorrow night in Ohio, and then end the week in another two crucial states, Wisconsin and Michigan.
Thank you for that.
