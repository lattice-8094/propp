In the Middle East Palestinian and Israeli delegations travel to Washington today for separate talks with US officials on reviving the stalled peace process.
As Ross Dunn reports, word of this week's talks came from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Mr. Arafat says separate Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will head for Washington in the next few days to hold talks with US officials on ways to revive the Middle East peace process.
Israeli and Palestinian officials have maintained contacts since the start of violence in late september but formal negotiations had been suspended.
Mr. Arafat also says he's willing to meet face to face with Prime Minister Barak if it would help the cause of peace, but such a meeting, he adds, should be well prepared.
Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abid Rabo says the Palestinian delegation will leave for Washington on Tuesday.
He says Palestinians want to find out if the Israelis have any new proposals to put on the table and to discuss with the US administration whether there is any possibility of resuming the negotiations.
