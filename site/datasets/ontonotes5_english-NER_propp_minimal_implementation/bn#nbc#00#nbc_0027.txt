While the two campaigns struggle over the outcome of the presidential election, tomorrow, in Washington, a high profile ceremony will be held on the Mall to mark the overdue beginning of a World War II memorial, but not even that moment is without controversy.
Here's Jim Miklaszewski.
In Washington today preparations for a Veterans Day tribute, many believe is long overdue.
Tomorrow, 55 years after America defeated Germany and Japan, a groundbreaking on the National Mall, for the first ever national memorial to World War II.
Navy vet and chairman Hayden Wiiams calling it a fitting legacy to the 16 million Americans who served in the war.
We were fighting for freedom, not only for us but for others.
At $ 141 million, mostly private donations, the monument will feature pillars that form an open circle.
Gold stars will commemorate the 400,000 Americans killed in the war, but these days, nothing in Washington comes easy.
The planning alone for this memorial has lasted longer than it took to win World War II, and now, the monument itself is caught up in controversy.
Not whether to build it, but where.
It's the right time.
It's the wrong site.
A small group of protesters has filed a lawsuit to move the memorial off the present sight.
This is an absolute intrusion.
John Graves fought the Nazis in the Battle of the Bulge and believes the new memorial would detract from the other monuments.
We do not want our legacy to be a controversy.
Other vets however, like former senator Bob Dole, say it's not only the right place, it's about time.
there would n't be any sight.
But the controversy sounds all too familiar.
Partisan bickering, public protests, even lawsuits.
That's what America is all about, and it's why America now remembers those who fought and won World War II.
