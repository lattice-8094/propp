Well, sex abuse by priests remains an issue in the Catholic Church in the United States and it is certain to be an issue as bishops gather tomorrow in St. Louis for their semiannual meeting.
Under a charter approved last year by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, diocese officials will report allegations of sexual abuse of a minor to public authorities.
Past, present or future sexual abuse of a minor will lead to removal from the ministry.
No priest or deacons who sexually abuse a minor may be transferred to another diocese.
With me now to talk more about the O'Brien case and the divisions still dividing the church are Barbara Blain, the founder of the Survivors Network in St. Louis and also joining us from Detroit Joe Mayor, the founder of a priest support group.
Barbara, to you first.
As the bishops get ready for this important meeting tomorrow, are you satisfied that they have taken all the appropriate steps to deal with the abuse issue ?
