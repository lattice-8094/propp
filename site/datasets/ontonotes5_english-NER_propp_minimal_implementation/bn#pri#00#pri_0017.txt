From NPR News in Washington, I am Corey Flintoff.
Israeli Army helicopters rocketed targets in the West Bank and Gaza today striking close to Yasser Arafat's headquarters and injuring at least a dozen people.
Israel said the attacks were in retaliation for the killings of at least two Israeli reservers who apparently became lost in the Palestinian town of Ramallah.
They sought refuge with Palestinian police but were later stabbed to death by a mob that stormed the police station.
The violence dealt another blow to the peace process.
Egypt condemned Israel's attacks today and said it has the approval of other Arab states to host a summit with the Palestinians and Israelis only if the violence stops.
Dale Gavlak reports from Cairo.
Foreign Minister Amre Moussa said Egypt is angry but this can not stop it from taking action from saving the peace process and ending attacks on the Palestinians.
We can not accept what happened today.
We can not accept it under any circumstances.
This is indeed a big blow to the peace process, a big blow to the relations in the region, a big blow to the stability in the Middle East.
This has to cease.
This has to stop and you have to stop it in a way that would bring together the parties concerned and get the necessary commitments from both, from them.
Moussa said Egypt has been in contact with President Clinton about a meeting to call the parties to examine the situation and turn it around.
He added that Egypt can not sit tight and let the crisis continue.
