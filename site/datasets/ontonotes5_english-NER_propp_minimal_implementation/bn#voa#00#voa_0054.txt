Cuban President Fidel Castro is scheduled to arrive in Venezuela Thursday to begin a five day visit at the invitation of President Hugo Chavez.
The two presidents are expected to sign an oil agreement aimed at helping to ease the Communist ruled Caribbean Island's chronic fuel shortage.
Mr. Castro's visit comes amid widespread labor unrest in Venezuela.
A major demonstration is set for Thursday, and Cuba has put into effect a 10 percent tax surcharge on telephone calls here to the United States.
The Cuban government took the step in retaliation for a Cuban funds bill passed by the US Congress.
The US legislation would use Cuban funds, long frozen in the US to compensate Cubans living in Miami for losses suffered at the hands of the Cuban government.
