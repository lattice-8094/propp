Family members and close allies of former President Slobodan Milosevic are leaving Yugoslavia ahead of possible investigations into their financial dealings.
Some are believed to have millions of dollars in foreign bank accounts.
Stefan Boss reports from Belgrade.
As Serbia is preparing to inaugurate a new government, some members of former President Slobodan Milosevic's family are leaving the country.
The son of Milosevic, Marco, tried unsuccessfully to flee to China, but he was refused entry and was on his way back to Moscow from where he came.
Earlier Marco Milosevic did not receive a visa in Russia, a situation which could only be cleared after his uncle and diplomats intervened.
It was seen as another sign that both Russia and China have abandoned their friendship with the Milosevic family and that they are seeking closer ties with new President Vojislav Kostunica.
