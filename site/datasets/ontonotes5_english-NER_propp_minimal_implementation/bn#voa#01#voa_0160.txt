President Clinton called for all weapons in Northern Ireland to be put away forever.
Mr. Clinton said Wednesday the United States would intensify cooperation with Britain and Ireland to fight groups seeking to undermine the Good Friday power showing agreement.
He was addressing a large gathering of people in East Belfast.
This is the last chance I will have as President to speak to the people of Northern Ireland.
Let me say to all of you that I have tried to be pretty straightforward today in my remarks and not nearly as emotional as I feel.
Mr. Clinton spoke at the end of his third official trip to Northern Ireland after holding talks with the province's leaders.
