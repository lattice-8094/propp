Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are beginning a new round of peace talks in Egypt, a session that could last ten days.
For Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, it's a chance to reach a peace agreement and boost his popularity with voters just weeks before Israeli elections.
The talks were proposed by the Palestinians, who say they 're ready to explore all possibilities.
Barak says he's holding firm on the key issues that led to the breakdown of the last round of talks.
