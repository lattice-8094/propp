In a push for the peacemaking process between the Palestinians and the Israelis, Blair explained yesterday at a news conference in Dubai at the conclusion of his Middle East tour that Iran is openly supporting terrorism in Iraq, ruining the Lebanese government, and obstructing the peace process in the Middle East.
Blair tried to remind the audience that Iran has never recognized Israel since the Islamic Revolution and that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called last year for wiping Israel off the map.
Blair said that we have to acknowledge the strategic challenge that the government of Iran poses, not its people, and perhaps not all elements of the regime, but those currently in charge of its policy.
Blair added that Iran wants to embroil us in Lebanon, Palestine and Iraq, emphasizing that the response should be to expose what it is doing, and to build alliances to prevent it and push it back in all parts of the region.
A spokesman for Blair denied allusions that his statements regarding Iran aim at inciting the Sunnis in the region against it, and at the same time Blair-who is leaving office next year-rejected the accusations directed at the United States and Britain of fueling terrorism in the Middle East.
The British Prime Minister called on the moderate leaders in the Middle East to join what he called a horrific struggle between democracy and extremism.
Blair-whose trip included visits to Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan-considered that the conflict between moderates and extremists will affect the security of the world in a broader sense.
Blair defined his priorities for the peace process, which are to support Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, improve the lives of the Palestinians, prepare for an early meeting between himself and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, and revive the political process in the context of a settlement based on the existence of two states.
