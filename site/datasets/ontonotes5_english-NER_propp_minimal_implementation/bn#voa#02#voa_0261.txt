A New York Federal Judge says he will allow the alleged confession of a suspect charged in the deadly 1998 bombings of two US embassies in Africa.
Judge Linnard Sand originally threw out Mohammed Rashid Dawood Alawali's statement because he said police forced his confession, but he changed his mind after new testimonies showed that the suspect waived his right to speak to an attorney after his arrest.
Mr. Alawali and three others are charged with the bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.
