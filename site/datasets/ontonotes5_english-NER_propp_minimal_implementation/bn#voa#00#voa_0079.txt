UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said Wednesday, it is important to help spread democracy around the world.
VOA's Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations.
In a new report, the Secretary General says democratization has now taken root as a universal norm and that the United Nations should strengthen its commitment to assisting nations that are moving toward democracy.
Commenting on the report, UN Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs Danilo Turk told reporters the principle of national sovereignty does not preclude support for democracy.
We are usually not sufficiently clear, we meaning the Secretariat, in explaining that sovereignty and final analysis belongs to the people and sovereignty should be seen in a democratic context.
Sovereignty is not simply a quality of statehood, but it has to do with the power of the people and democratic structures which make sovereignty an important human value.
Mr. Churk also has said that a lack of democracy is the root cause of many contemporary armed conflicts.
The Secretary General's report says democracy can develop anywhere and that it is a common misperception that democracy is a Western concept.
The report was issued in advance of a UN-sponsored conference on new and restored democracies that will be held in the African nation of Benin in early December.
