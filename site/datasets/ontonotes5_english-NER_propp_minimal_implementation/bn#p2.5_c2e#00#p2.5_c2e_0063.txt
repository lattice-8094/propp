Regarding the progress of the North Korea nuclear issue, uh, Korean Central News Agency released an editorial yesterday.
In this editorial, it mentioned, uh, saying that the entire international community is earnestly anticipating that the six party talks could resume.
Japan is the only exception.
Among these, uh, it also accused, saying that Japan intended to sabotage the six party talks, so as to prevent the North Korea nuclear issue from being fairly resolved.
Prior to the holding of six party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue, uh, Japan requested that North Korea must abandon its nuclear program and meanwhile, must also resolve the hostage issue between Japan and North Korea.
This editorial believed, saying that, ah, this, uh, actually had poisoned the negotiation atmosphere of the six-party talks.
Well, at the same time, uh, this editorial, uh, also believed, saying that the hostage issue and the North Korea nuclear issue were in fact two totally unrelated issues, so it did not make any sense that Japan raised this issue.
It also denounced the earlier speech, uh, by er, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso.
Taro Aso proposed at an earlier time, saying that, uh, Japan would not accept North Korea as a nuclear country returning to the negotiation table, meanwhile, uh, also requesting that North Korea must dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Well, with regard to the US, uh, if it did not change its position, this editorial also said, it would then be impossible to hold the six-party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue in December, nor would it be possible in the future unless the US changed its position.
