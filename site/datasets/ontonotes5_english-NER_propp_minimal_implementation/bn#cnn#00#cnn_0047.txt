The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution criticizing Israel's actions in the dispute.
The resolution also calls for an immediate end to the violence and a resumption of peace talks.
The United States was one of six nations that voted against the measure.
More than 100 people have died in the three weeks of fighting, almost all of them Palestinians or Arab-Israelis.
