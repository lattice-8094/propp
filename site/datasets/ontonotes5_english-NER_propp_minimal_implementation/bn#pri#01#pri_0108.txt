The Gulf War began 10 years ago tonight and ended 6 weeks later with a decisive US victory over Iraq, but little has changed since then.
The two nations are still bitter enemies.
The United States continues to insist that UN sanctions remain against Iraq until Baghdad completely dismantles its programs of weapons of mass destruction.
The only exception to the trade embargo is the UN Oil for Food Program, which President Saddam Hussein grudgingly accepted 5 years ago.
That program has helped provide Iraqis with basic foods and stabilize the economy somewhat, but Iraq complains that the program is inadequate.
Under it Baghdad has sold 40 billion dollars worth of oil and has received only 10 billion dollars worth of goods.
The rest of the money, 30 billion dollars, has gone to pay war reparations, assist the Kurds in northern Iraq and pay for the UN operation.
Today Iraq's Oil Minister, Omar Mohammed Rashid called for an end to the Oil for Food Program.
You can not run a country with 23 million people with revenues of 16 billion to 20 billion dollars.
You run it from a security council.
This is totally impossible, even with all the good faith.
So just imagine with all the bad faith.
We know there is absolutely no hope for this program to succeed.
There were other signs today that Iraq's leaders have few regrets over the action that precipitated the Gulf War.
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister defended the 1990 invasion of Kuwait and claimed that his country was the victim of a conspiracy, and Saddam Hussein's eldest son Uday, who is a member of the Parliament, proposed that Kuwait should be included in a new map of Iraq.
