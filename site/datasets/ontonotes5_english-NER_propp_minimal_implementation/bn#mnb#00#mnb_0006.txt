There are new terrorisms concerns to report in the Persian Gulf tonight.
Those in the region are in the highest state of alert after U.S. intelligence has picked up, serious, incredible threats there.
All of this comes as the USS Cole is being carried home, a destroyer carried home on the deck of a larger ship after a hole was blown in its side.
Our report on all of this tonight from NBC News Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski.
20 miles out to sea, the crippled Cole is loaded on to the heavy lift ship, Blue Marlin.
In this video, the Marlin submerges.
Tugs push the Cole into position over the deck and the Marlin rises to lift the 8,000-ton warship out of the water.
The Cole will take the long way home, around the southern tip of Africa, avoiding the Suez Canal because of ongoing terrorist threats.
The entire trip will take 35 days.
Yemen authorities are still not fully cooperating with the FBI and U.S. investigators still do n't have any firm evidence to directly link any suspects to the attack on the Cole.
