The United States says it may invite Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington as part of efforts to resume Mid East peace negotiations.
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Washington is exploring the possibility of hosting direct talks between negotiators to build a bridge back to the peace process.
A senior US official added that if the two sides agree, the talks could take place in the middle of next week.
The US commitment follows a surprise meeting between Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Israeli negotiator Gilead Share left the meeting saying an agreement is still possible.
It is still our assessment that such an agreement is possible within the framework of what we call in a generic name, Camp David.
Under this notion we do assess that Arafat and the Palestinian leadership understand and realize now, that this is a fair, just and reasonable set of ideas that could well be considered as a framework for a permanent status.
The bid for talks was followed by more violence.
Israeli forces killed at least six Palestinians during a number of clashes Friday.
