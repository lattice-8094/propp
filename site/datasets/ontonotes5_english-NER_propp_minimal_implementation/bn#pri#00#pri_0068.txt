Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak will call early elections.
In a speech before Parliament, Barak said the date of the ballot will be announced within the next few days.
Parliament had been debating an opposition motion to hold an early vote.
Barak's statement is seen as an attempt to seize the initiative after it appeared likely he would lose the debate.
