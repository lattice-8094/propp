Meanwhile, a diplomatic source in Geneva said that the United Nations Human Rights Council will hold an emergency session in two weeks time about the conflict in Darfur in response to a request by the European Union and a number of African states.
He indicated that the one-day session would be held between the 11th and 13th of this month.
The German news agency quoted Wilhelm as saying that the German army does not intend to go beyond the logistical assistance it has been giving to date, even if the United Nations ratifies a new peace mission in the region.
These statements came after sharp criticism directed at Minister of Defense, Franz Josef Jung, following his statements about the possibility of the German army participating in Sudan as part of a United Nations mission.
These statements provoked mixed reactions from German politicians, meeting strong rejection from some politicians, including leaders of the Christian Alliance, whom Chancellor Angela Merkel is affiliated with, while they were supported by politicians from the opposition Green Party.
In Geneva, Agence France Presse quoted United Nations spokesman Rolando Gomez as saying that 28 states out of the 47 members of the Human Rights Council had signed a request to hold a special session on Darfur.
It takes only a third of member states, i.e. 16, for such a session to be held.
Gomez stated that the request to hold an emergency session on Darfur was " submitted to the president of the Human Rights Council ", Mexican Ambassador Luis Alfonso de Alba.
The United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, convened the Council on Wednesday to organize an emergency session on Darfur rapidly, taking into account that the Council's credibility was on the line.
Louise Arbour, the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that " atrocities are still being committed daily " in Darfur, directly accusing the Sudanese authorities.
