In Israel the latest opinion polls show hard-liner Ariel Sharon is virtually assured of winning next week's national election.
The story from Ross Don in Jerusalem.
An opinion poll published in the Jerusalem Post newspaper Wednesday shows that Ariel Sharon, Chairman of the right wing Likud Party, has a commanding 22-point lead over Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
According to the poll, 49 percent of those interviewed said they would vote for Mr. Sharon while 27 percent would support Mr. Barak.
Another Poll, this one in the Hebrew daily Yudiad Acronod found that Mr. Sharon had a 16 % lead over Mr. Barak.
All such surveys show the gap between the two candidates is widening but that former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, a member of Mr. Barak's Labour Party, would have a better chance of defeating Mr. Sharon, but despite his poor standing in the opinion polls, Mr. Barak says he has no intention of standing down in favor of Mr. Peres.
The Hebrew daily newspaper Harord says that Mr. Barak's inner circle of advisors has told him he may have to reconsider his position.
