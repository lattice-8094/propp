Yesterday, hundreds gathered in the West Bank town of Hebron for the funeral of a Palestinian woman killed in her home by crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen, and in Gaza, a second funeral took place for a Palestinian man killed Friday night by Israeli troops.
Palestinian security officials insist they can not quell the unrest in the West Bank and Gaza until Israel lifts its blockade there.
