Brazilian officials say an oil tanker has crashed into a pier in a resort area, spilling more than 86,000 liters of crude oil into the ocean.
The state-owned Petro Basque tanker hit the concrete pier in San Sebastian, a popular resort south of Sao Paulo.
Workers sealed the leaking hull and contained the spill, but authorities say the oil is still threatening local beaches.
Saturday's incident was the sixth Petro Basque spill this year.
