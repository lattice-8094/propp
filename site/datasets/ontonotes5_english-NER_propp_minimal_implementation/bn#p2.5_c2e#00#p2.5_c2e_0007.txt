In order to raise money for charity for orphans in the SOS Children's Villages, on the fifth, a pair of American sexagenarians set out from Texas aboard a helicopter to begin their second trip around the poles.
Early in the morning, sixty-six-year-old Jennifer Murray and fifty-five-year-old Colin Bodill made their way to the departure point one by one to begin the final preparations for the new journey.
This time, what they fly is also a red Bell 407 helicopter.
According to their plans, the two seniors will cross South America to get to the South Pole and then turn the helicopter around to head for the North Pole, and finally take a path across Russia and other European countries before crossing Canada to return to the US.
The entire trip will be completed in May of next year.
It will take one hundred and sixty-nine days, cross thirty-four countries and fly more than thirty-six thousand nautical miles.
Besides collecting money for charity, they will also photograph and survey changes in the geographical environment along the route, especially the threatening situation posed by global warming to the polar glaciers, and so on.
Actually, as early as the end of 2003, Jennifer and Colin had already made an attempt at realizing their dream of flying over the two poles.
But due to the peculiar polar weather condition, the helicopter crashed in the end on the South Pole's Ronne Ice Shelf.
Fortunately, the two both managed to survive.
Colin was also awarded two medals of courage due to his saving of his partner's life.
