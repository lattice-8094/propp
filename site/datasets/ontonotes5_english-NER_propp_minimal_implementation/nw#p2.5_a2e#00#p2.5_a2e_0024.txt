Lahoud asserted that any intervention by the United States of America and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to impede all efforts being exerted to end the abnormal situation which Lebanon is currently experiencing.
He reaffirmed that the first task of the new government is to reach a decision on the issue of the International Tribunal, enact a new law for legislative elections, and hold the elections as soon as possible so that the parliament can elect the next president of the republic by the deadline stipulated in the constitution.
For his part, Ismail said that he transmitted a verbal message from President Al-Bashir to Lahoud in which he expressed his " concern about the developments, and the importance for all institutions and active forces to hold back this escalation and transfer the dialogue to meeting halls under the dome of the parliament, and reach an expanded government that includes the political forces, " noting that there is concern by all Lebanese parties that things could get worse and that there is consensus about the preference for moving the dialogue from the streets to the parliament, the importance of expanding the government, and that the opposition forces should effectively participate in it.
Ismail also visited with Prime Minister Fouad Siniora in the governmental palace and reiterated his previous positions.
