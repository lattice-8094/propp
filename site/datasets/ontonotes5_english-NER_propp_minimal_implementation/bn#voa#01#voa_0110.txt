Prime Minister Ehud Barak defends Israel's bombardment of Palestinian targets in the Gaza Strip in response to a bomb attack on a school bus in Gaza that killed two Jewish settlers and injured at least nine, some of them children.
VOA correspondent Eve Connan in Jerusalem reports.
Dozens of people are reported injured in the air raids which Palestinian leaders are calling an act of criminal aggression.
As night fell, Israeli combat helicopters fired dozens of missiles at targets in the Gaza Strip, striking near the office of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Targets included a police station and security headquarters.
Parts of Gaza were plunged into darkness as electricity went off during the raids.
Following the strikes, Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Israel would use all force necessary with no restraints to end weeks of violence.
He described the bombing of a school bus traveling from a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip early Monday, as a barbaric and terrorist act, and said no negotiations were currently underway with the Palestinian leadership.
Earlier, the Palestinian authority issued a statement denying involvement in the school bus attack.
Palestinian leaders accused Israel of choosing a path of war by launching the strikes and called for international intervention.
