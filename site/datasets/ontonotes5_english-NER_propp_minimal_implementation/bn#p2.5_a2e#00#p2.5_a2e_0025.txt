The Cold War cost Latin America the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.
In Nicaragua alone, fifty thousand died in the Sandinista revolution, and another fifty thousand in the civil war.
That was frightful.
There were many murder victims, refugees, and displaced people.
From a different perspective, the situation could have been much worse if we had done nothing to prevent the establishment of communist regimes in the countries of Central America other than Nicaragua.
Suppose they were established in El Salvador, then in Guatemala and maybe in Honduras during the eighties : if we had not taken the steps we took, the direct suffering would have been much greater.
In the year 1990, the leader of the Sandinistas, Daniel Ortega, was asking the people of Nicaragua to elect him president.
Former American President Jimmy Carter was there to view the impartiality of the election.
Violeta Chamorro, Ortega's rival, won by a tight margin and sudden victory, and Washington spent ten million dollars in support of her campaign.
