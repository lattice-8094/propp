Dozens of Palestinians were wounded in scattered clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Wednesday, despite the Sharm el-Sheikh truce accord.
The clashes occurred as the Palestinian leadership issued orders to observe the troops.
The Palestinian leaders also warned that Israel must remove its soldiers from the outskirts of Palestinian cities.
Israel says, it has lifted the internal restrictions that barred Palestinians from moving among West Bank towns and villages.
