Judges at the Flight 103 Lockerbie trial are expected to rule Thursday if a diary belonging to one of the accused can be used as evidence.
The defendant's diary was discovered by Scottish police during an investigation in Malta in April 1991.
The defense claims that police search was illegal and therefore the diary can not be admitted as evidence.
