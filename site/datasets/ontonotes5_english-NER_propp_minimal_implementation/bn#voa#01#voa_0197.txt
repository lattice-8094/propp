Britain's Millennium Dome will close down this coming Monday after a year of mishaps.
Officials at London's Millennium Dome say the structure will close down after a final New Year's Eve party.
They say it will be likely sold to a developer and be turned into a technology park.
Problems riddled the Dome even before its grand opening last New Year's Eve.
Construction delays and cost-overruns hurt the project, which was originally expected to cost at least 1 billion 300 million dollars.
Dome officials had to seek an additional 265 million dollars to complete the structure.
