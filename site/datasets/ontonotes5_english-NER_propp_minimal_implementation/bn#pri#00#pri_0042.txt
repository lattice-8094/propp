Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak opened parliament today with only a minority government behind him, but with a promise of support that could keep his government operating for at least a month.
An ultra-orthodox party said it will support Barak's dwindling coalition for 30 days when he negotiates with the right wing Likud Party in an effort to form a government of national unity.
Meanwhile, violence between Israeli troops and Palestinian demonstrators stretched into its 33rd day.
Gunmen killed an Israeli guard and a missing Israeli was found murdered on the outskirts of Jerusalem.
Israeli troops wounded more than 40 Palestinians.
Five Palestinians were killed yesterday bringing the overall death toll to more than 140.
