President Emile Lahoud believed that " the opposition has a right to one-third plus one in government with the goal of participating, not invalidating " and described the idea of appointing a neutral minister who does not resign or vote on important issues as " heresy ".
He repeated that " there is no way out of the present situation other than through a national unity government in which all sides are represented and which takes charge of setting up a fair and non-politicized international court.
It will put in place modern laws for the parliamentary elections, with equality between all regions, on the basis of which a new parliament and a new President of the Republic will be elected to represent the Lebanese ".
Lahoud continued, in a speech he gave yesterday before a delegation of the follow-up committee of the " First Conference of the Arab Resistance in Iqlim Kharoub " led by former deputy Zahir Al-Khatib, with his campaign against the United States, French President Jacques Chirac and the parliamentary majority, in which he emphasized that " a civil war will not occur in Lebanon ".
He said that " I am the boy's father and it is my duty to maintain the constitution ; this is my strength ".
Just by agreeing to an interim government, there will be two governments, and this will affect the army and many state matters.
I can not agree to two governments in Lebanon.
All I ask for is there in the constitution.
This ministry is not legitimate and they know it.
Can peaceful demonstrations happen in the form they are taking place today in spite of the large number of demonstrators ?
They want to create problems, then they say they want to bring the Lebanese together.
But bringing the Lebanese together is not only a matter of words ; it requires work as happened when the army was united.
