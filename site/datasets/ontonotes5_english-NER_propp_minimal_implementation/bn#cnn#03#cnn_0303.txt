I'm Allan Chernoff at the New York Stock Exchange.
American Airlines, a second major union at American is planning a new vote on the company's cost cutting agreement.
The unions are outraged that a bonus plan for top executives that had not been fully disclosed before the union voted to take pay cuts.
The Transport Brokers Union made the revote last night moments before the CEO publicly apologized to his employees.
Carty said he thought the employees would like the plan that meant to keep the executives that company, but he concealed the details fearing the story would cause problems when they were asking employees for big concessions.
Shares of American Airlines are falling sharply for the second straight day on the fears that the company might be forced to file for bankruptcy.
The stock market has bounced back from a weak start.
A lot more earnings reports out today, many positive, a few disappointments sprinkled in, as well.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up by 16 points right now and the Nasdaq composite higher by 6 points.
