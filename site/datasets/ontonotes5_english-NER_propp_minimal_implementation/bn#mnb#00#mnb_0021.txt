Let's check in with the court where it's the law enforcement watch.
Dan Abrams outside the building.
Dan, if you had to make a case that it could be tonight, what are the signs ?
Well, I think the number one most important sign is looking at what happened last night, and that is last night at about 7:00, the public information officer of the court came to us and said we 're going home.
We are told, in effect, there wo n't be a ruling tonight.
That has n't happened tonight.
Now, you know the time is ticking away and yet they are still here.
Everyone still here.
All we know is that justices Breyer and Souter have been seen driving away, but that does n't necessarily tell us anything.
There are all sorts of possible explanations for that.
It could be that they 're not actually involved in finishing up writing one of the opinions.
Remember, very often, the justices are joint in another justice's opinion.
It also could be that the opinion is already finished, and, of course, there's always the possibility that it's not finished, but I think the fact that the public information office and many security officers here at the court are still here tells us that the court is in all likelihood still working on this case.
Dan Abrams, outside the, still active court tonight.
Thank you for that.
