Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has visited a tense region near the Serbian-Kosovo border, which has been the scene of deadly attacks by ethnic Albanian separatists.
Mr. Kostunica arrived in the town of Beonovach late Monday and was welcomed by hundreds of people.
The Yugoslav leader pledged to bring peace to the area where an increase in fighting last week between the Albanian guerillas and Serbian security forces left four police officers dead.
