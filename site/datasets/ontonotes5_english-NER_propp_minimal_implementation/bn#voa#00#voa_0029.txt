Israeli helicopter gunships struck Palestinian targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Thursday.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of Israeli soldiers.
This morning, the entire world was the witness of a cold-blooded brutal lynch of two or three Israelis within a Palestinian police station in Ramallah in the Palestinian-controlled territories.
Late Thursday, Mr. Barak invited Likud opposition leader Ariel Sharon to join him in a government of national emergency.
It was a visit by Mr. Sharon to a Jerusalem religious holy site that sparked the violence that began last month between Israelis and Palestinian protesters.
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan who is leading mediation efforts in the Middle East urged Palestinians and Israelis, Thursday to show restraint.
Both Jordan's King Abdullah and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad charged Israel with insulting Arabs and Muslims by violating their rights at holy sites.
