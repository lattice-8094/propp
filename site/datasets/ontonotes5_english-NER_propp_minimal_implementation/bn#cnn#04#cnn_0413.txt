The head of the Catholic Church in Phoenix, Arizona, Bishop Thomas O'Brien has resigned, just one day after being charged with a felony.
He is accused of leaving the scene of a fatal accident.
Earlier this month O'Brien narrowly escaped prosecution over his handling of sexual abuse allegations against priests.
