The UN Security Council approved on Tuesday, a draft resolution for the establishment of an international court concerning the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and expressed its severe condemnation of the assassination of Lebanon's Industry Minister Pierre Gemayel, after discussions dominated by news of Gemayel's assassination.
Hariri was killed on February 14, 2004 during what has become known as the era of " Syrian tutelage " in Lebanon.
After this attack, Damascus was forced to withdraw its soldiers from Lebanon, after nearly 30 years of presence there, through pressure from the public and the international community.
Reports by the International Investigation Commission pointed to the involvement of Syrian and Lebanese officials in the crime.
In statements reported by Al-Hayat newspaper today, Wednesday, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister, Faisal Al-Miqdad, said that Syria " would not agree to any of its citizens appearing before an international court because we trust our courts ", pointing out that the formation of an international tribunal to look into Al-Hariri's assassination " would put Syria under political pressure ".
He added that his country's position was based " on the following :
firstly, Syria is 100 % innocent of the crime and there is no need to corroborate this.
Secondly, if there was any Syrian citizen that might have been involved in this crime, then he would be a criminal and punished in the same way as any criminal appearing before the impartial Syrian courts ".
He clarified that the United Nations had resorted to setting up international courts in other parts of the world such as Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia because " the courts there had collapsed but our courts are independent and fair and so we will not agree to any Syrian citizen being brought before an international court because we have confidence in our courts ".
