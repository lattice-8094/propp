Dog Chapman was in the same truck you saw.
At one point, the Mexican police busted both Andrew Luster and Dwayne Dog Chapman, because they do n't like bounty hunters in Mexico.
Chapman remains behind bars as we speak in Mexico.
Andrew Luster, though arrived yesterday at Los Angeles International Airport on a commercial flight from Mexico.
As soon as he arrived--thoom being walked by the FBI to a van belonging to the Ventura County sheriff's folks.
He was taken to a prison in Kearn County, California, about 100 miles from Los Angeles, a place mostly known for its grapes.
Make of that what you may.
