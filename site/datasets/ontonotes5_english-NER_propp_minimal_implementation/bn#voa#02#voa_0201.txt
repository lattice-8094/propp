Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has staged a major military staff reshuffle to remove officers associated with long time ruler Slobodan Milosevic.
The President has retired fourteen senior officers from active duty.
These include Admiral Milanzech, head of the Navy, General Gezafarcus, Chief of Military Intelligence and General Vragulyuv Voidanich, a former Defense Minister.
In the meantime, a disputed area in southern Serbia's Presavo Valley has reopened to traffic after Serb police and Albanian rebel fighters agreed to dismantle two roadblocks.
