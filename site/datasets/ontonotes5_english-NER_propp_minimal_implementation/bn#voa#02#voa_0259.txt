Prime Minister Barak's decision not to meet Yasser Arafat this week comes after the Palestinian leader's angry speech on Sunday at an economic forum in Switzerland.
Mr. Arafat accused Israel of waging a savage and barbaric war against his people.
One day earlier Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had announced that a week of marathon talks have brought them closer than ever to a final agreement.
After the angry outburst Mr. Arafat reaffirmed his commitment to peace and his willingness to meet Mr. Barak.
The meeting was expected later this week in Stockholm, but Mr. Barak's security advisor told Israeli Radio Monday such a meeting now is out of the question.
He described the Arafat speech as inflammatory.
Mr. Barak can not risk the controversial meeting ahead of next week's election.
He still trails far behind the hard line Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon in the opinion polls.
