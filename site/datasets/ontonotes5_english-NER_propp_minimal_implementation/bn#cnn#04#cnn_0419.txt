Convicted rapist and Max Factor heir Andrew Luster is back in California.
Luster returned to Los Angeles yesterday from Mexico following his capture Tuesday by American bounty hunters.
Luster skipped bail during his trial in January for raping and drugging three women.
He was sentenced in abstentia to 124 years in prison.
