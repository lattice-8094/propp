Given Iran's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities, three countries--France, Britain and Germany--with the support of the United States, circulated a draft resolution on sanctions against Iran at the UN Security Council on the 8th, in which, it suggested a sanction against the 12 Iranians suspected of involvement in the nuclear program.
However, according to a U.S. Washington Post report on the 11th, the list of Iranians provided by the U.S. State Department was actually obtained from an Internet search.
Even the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency had doubts about its accuracy.
According to insider sources cited by the Washington Post, the CIA felt that the U.S. had committed major mistakes in its intelligence provided to the UN Security Council prior to the Iraq War, hence they could not afford to make another mistake on the Iranian issue, and therefore refused to provide the list to the State Department.
The State Department had no choice but to assign a junior official to search for the names online.
After entering a few keywords, such as Iran nuclear program and others, this official selected 12 names with the highest hit rate, and finally wrote them into the Security Council draft resolution.
The draft clearly pointed out that these 12 people ought to be sanctioned, including placing a ban on their international travels and participation in international business activities.
According to reports, related CIA officials said none of the people mentioned on the list were directly related to Iran's secret nuclear program.
But the U.S. State Department still included this list obtained from an Internet search in the UN Security Council draft resolution submitted by France, Germany, and Britain.
This will greatly weaken the persuasiveness of the draft.
