It's Election Day in the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
Voters are choosing a new parliament.
Polls show President Vojislav Kostunica's government could win the majority it needs to begin introducing its reforms.
Earlier today, former President Slobodan Milosevic cast his ballot.
If his party loses as predicted, Milosevic could be vulnerable to U.N. war crimes prosecution.
Preliminary results are expected later today.
