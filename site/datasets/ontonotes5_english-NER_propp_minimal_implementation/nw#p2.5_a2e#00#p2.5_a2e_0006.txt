In a medical breakthrough at the Alawi Tunisi & Brothers Hospital in Holy Mecca, a 37 year old Sudanese woman gave birth to quintuplets, by God's grace.
The woman had suffered from secondary infertility for around three years.
Doctor Salahudin Hamid, a consultant in gynecology, obstetrics and infertility, said that the woman had been attending a gynecology and infertility clinic and had undergone the necessary tests and had received ovulatory stimulation treatment to which she responded, through God's grace.
The first visit showed that it was a multiple pregnancy.
She was monitored regularly throughout the pregnancy and had all the necessary tests to bring the pregnancy as far along as possible.
At 10:00 pm on Friday December 10 she was in the 34th week of pregnancy, so an emergency Caesarean section had to be performed, led by Salahudin Hamad, Maisa Shalan Badran and Imaduldin Said Abada.
Five very healthy babies were born, by God's grace, three boys and two girls, whose weight ranged from 1800 grams to 1200 grams.
Doctor Mohammed Abdulkarim, pediatrics and neonatology consultant monitoring the children's condition at the Alawi Tunisi Hospital, said that the children were in stable condition and did not need intensive care.
