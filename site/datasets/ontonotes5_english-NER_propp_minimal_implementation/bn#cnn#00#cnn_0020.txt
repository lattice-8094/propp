The United Nations Security Council has passed a resolution condemning what it calls `` acts of violence, especially the excessive use of force against Palestinians. ''
U.S. diplomats had opposed wording which apparently blamed the new round of clashes on an Israeli opposition leader's visit to a shrine venerated by both sides.
The Security Council vote was unanimous, with the United States abstaining.
