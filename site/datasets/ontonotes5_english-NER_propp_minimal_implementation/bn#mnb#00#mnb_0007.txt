Now to the terrorist bombing of the USS Cole.
The damage, much worse than previously believed.
It's in the form of new pictures obtained by NBC News.
For the first time with the Cole out of the water, the full impact of the catastrophic blast, clearly visible.
In these photos obtained by NBC News, the damage much larger than first imagined, extending well below the water line.
Workers on deck, large sections of the hull buckled inward.
A crewman Sean Powell back home in Florida said inside the Cole it was chaos, it got dark, we lost power, the ship started to list, that's what scared everybody.
Navy officials predict the Cole can be repaired for about $ 150 million and put back into service, but Justice Department officials say in Yemen, the FBI's investigation is dead in the water.
Senior U.S. officials tell NBC News the Yemen government has all but shut down all cooperation in finding those behind the Cole attack.
Evidence is either withheld or tampered with.
A surveillance video at the harbor at the time of the attack was so heavily edited it did n't even show the blast itself.
Why ?
Yemen is a terrorist hot bed.
U.S. officials say some members of the President's own cabinet have direct ties to radical Islamic extremists and terrorists.
It's hard to see exactly why it is that the President there would ever want to cooperate with the United States and possibly put himself in jeopardy.
Even though cooperation from Yemen is at a stand still, U.S. officials tell NBC News they 're making substantial progress in the investigation and are fully confident they 'll eventually gather enough evidence to retaliate against those responble.
