Beijing 12-18-LRB-AFP-RRB--Pyongyang upped its conditions when the six-party talks resumed today, Monday, in Beijing, after it had boycotted the talks for over a year.
It called for the lifting of the international sanctions which were imposed after it carried out its first nuclear test.
With this, North Korea, which has possessed a nuclear bomb since October 9th, will have added another condition for abandoning its military nuclear program.
A source who participated in the negotiations told Agence France Presse, " The North Koreans insisted that negotiations to implement the September 2005 agreement would not be possible unless American financial sanctions and United Nations sanctions are lifted beforehand. "
China, the United States, the two Koreas, Japan and Russia are taking part in the negotiations which began three years ago with the aim of forcing North Korea to abandon its nuclear arsenal.
Kim Jong-Il's regime is still insisting on the lifting of US sanctions imposed on it, without making it a condition that international sanctions, approved on October 14th by the Security Council which includes its closest ally China, be lifted in order to dismantle its nuclear weapons.
In the course of the penultimate round of negotiations in September 2005, the six countries signed a joint statement in which Washington recognized North Korea's right to have a civilian nuclear industry, in exchange for Kim Jong-Il's regime agreeing to abandon its military nuclear program, and signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty from which it withdrew in January.
