Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad is claiming responsibility for a bombing today at a small Israeli grocery store in Israel, but near the West Bank board.
The store's owner and the Palestinian bomber were killed.
The store is a total loss.
The Israeli, 63 years old was in the store.
There's some indication the Palestinian suicide bomber had expected more Israelis to be inside, but there were n't any other Israelis there.
He blew himself up apparently as a result.
The investigation is continuing.
Islamic Jihad has so far claimed responsibility for that.
Secretary of State Colin Powell says some progress is being made despite all of this, towards a truce involving Palestinian militants.
Powell is wrapping up a trip to Southeast Asia.
He's due here in Jerusalem tomorrow morning for talks with the Israeli Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.
Later, he's supposed to helicopter to Jericho on the West Bank to meet with the Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas.
