Clashes between Palestinians and security forces swept the West Bank and Gaza again Sunday in a fourth straight day of deadly confrontations.
Among the 27 fatalities were an Israeli-Arab border guard and a 10-year-old Palestinian boy.
The clashes spread from East Jerusalem to the Palestinian territories and Arab villages in Israel.
The Israeli Army said the border guard died in a clash with Palestinian rioters at Joseph's Tomb, a fortified Jewish pilgrimage site in Palestinian-controlled Nablus.
