President Bush reminds me of the proverb, " Too much of anything will turn against itself. "
He has listened to the opinions of all the people on the subject of the war against Iraq, to the point where he has decided to postpone his speech about any change of direction there from this month to the next.
Everyone has heard about the Baker-Hamilton report, but the president has received this week other reports from both the Department of State and Department of Defense, and from the National Security Council.
He spoke directly with Dr. Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld, and he listened to military commanders, including the joint chiefs of staff, and to others outside the government.
He then conducted a closed-circuit television communication with field commanders in Iraq as well as divine communications through his open line to " Upstairs. "
And between this and that, he met with Iraqi Vice-President Tarik Al-Hashimi, before him Abdel-Aziz Al-Hakim, the Head of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and prior to them with Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki.
All the preceding is either incidental or transient, but the permanent is the existence of 16 American government intelligence agencies, each of which submits its own reports to the president, and together they submit the " National Intelligence Estimate " each year, with the National Intelligence Director, a newly created post currently occupied by John Negroponte, supervising the intelligence work.
President Bush does not read, and if he reads he does not understand.
He listens and he forgets, for words go in one ear and out the other, while the president is thinking about fishing on his ranch in Texas where the local opinion about him is that he is " A cowboy with a hat, without any cattle. "
