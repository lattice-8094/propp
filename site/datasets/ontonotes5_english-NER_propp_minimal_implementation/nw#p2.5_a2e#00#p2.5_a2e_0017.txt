A classified British document revealed that Britain had considered implementing a plan that would have changed the course of the Nile in order to put pressure on former President Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1956 to relent on his decision to nationalize the Suez Canal.
The document, which was published yesterday as part of a number of British Intelligence documents that were declassified after the passage of fifty years, stated that the commanders of the British army who prepared the plan believed the course of the Nile could be changed to cut off 90 % of the water reaching the Egyptian lands.
This would damage vast agricultural areas in Egypt, as well as transportation, and would thereby destroy the Egyptian economy and weaken Abdel Nasser internally.
According to this plan, it was decided that Britain would use a dam in Uganda in order to lower the water level in the White Nile by seven-eighths.
The plan was actually presented to the British Prime Minister at the time, Anthony Eden, several weeks before the start of the tripartite attacks on Egypt, in which Britain, France, and Israel participated.
The document stated that the implementation of the plan was later abandoned because Britain feared it might backfire violently on the Egyptian side.
Also, those who prepared the plan realized that the project might take months to carry out, and in addition would cause damage to other countries, such as Kenya and Uganda.
The document also revealed that John Hunt, the former British Cabinet Secretary, observed that the plan could only be effective if a rumor was spread among Egyptians-who were mostly illiterate at the time-that if Abdel Nasser did not step down, Britain would lower the level of the Nile.
