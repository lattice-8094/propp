WorldCom says it agreed to pay $ 88 million to settle a class-action lawsuit claim that it overcharged customers on long distance telephone calls.
The settlement follows a 1998 suit arguing that WorldCom then known as MCI WorldCom automatically shifted customers who were late in paying their bills into a higher rate plan.
MCI and Worldcom merged in 1998, before splitting again last year.
WorldCom did not admit any wrongdoing in settling the case.
