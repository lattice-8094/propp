In a New Year's message to the Serbian people, President Vojislav Kostunica said the year 2001 will be a time of domestic healing after the triumph of what he called freedom without violence.
Mr. Kostunica was referring to the popular uprising in October that forced former President Slobodan Milosevic to accept electoral defeat.
Mr. Kostunica stressed that legal ways must be found to solve the issue of Montenegro's drive for independence.
