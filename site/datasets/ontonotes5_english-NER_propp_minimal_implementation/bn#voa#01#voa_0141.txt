The city of Los Angeles has announced that it wants to become the first city to host the Olympics three times.
The city that staged the summer games in 1932 and 1984 is hoping to host the summer games in 2012.
Other US cities expected to submit bids by the December 15th deadline are Dallas, Washington, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Houston, New York, San Francisco and Tampa, Florida.
The US Olympic Committee will make its choice in late 2002 and the International Olympic Committee will select the host city in 2005.
