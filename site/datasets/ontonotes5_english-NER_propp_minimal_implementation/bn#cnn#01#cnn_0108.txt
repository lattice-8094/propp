A United Nations conference on global warming has ended without a deal.
Delegates worked through the night and past a deadline in the Netherlands to find ways to implement the Kyoto Protocol.
The Protocol's objective is to reduce the earth's heat-trapping gases by 5 % in 12 years.
Delegates have been unable to agree on how to do that.
The sticking point is how countries can reduce gas emissions without actually burning less fossil fuel.
