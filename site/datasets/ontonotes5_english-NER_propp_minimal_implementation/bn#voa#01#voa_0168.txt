The Clinton administration is expressing confidence the UN Security Council will vote next week to tighten sanctions against Afghanistan's dominant Taliban faction.
Assistant US Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs Carl Enderforth said on Friday the Taliban's refusal to comply with a UN anti-terrorism resolution last year forced the move to toughen sanctions.
He says trade and humanitarian shipments of food and medicine as well as religious pilgrimages will not be affected.
