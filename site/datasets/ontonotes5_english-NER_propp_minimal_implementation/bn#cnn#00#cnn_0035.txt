Yugoslavia's new President, Vojislav Kostunica, is still having trouble consolidating his power.
Kostunica's supporters and allies of Slobodan Milosevic failed to agree today on a transitional government and a new election in Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
Kostunica is enjoying more success abroad.
He got some support today as he attended a summit of European Union leaders in France.
The EU promised Yugoslavia $ 175 million in aid without attaching conditions.
