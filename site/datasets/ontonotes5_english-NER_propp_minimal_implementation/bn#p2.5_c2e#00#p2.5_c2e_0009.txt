As many as 10,000 residential households and work units have been left without heating since the early hours of December 3 over a total area of four million square meters in the Shuimogou and Tianshan districts of Urumqi, Xinjiang, because there was a breakdown in the equipment of the electricity company responsible for the task of providing heat.
According to monitoring readings taken by the local meteorological department, over the last two days, the lowest temperature at night in Urumqi has been about 14 degrees Celsius below zero.
The lack of heating has caused a lot of inconvenience for people's lives.
