Finally tonight, humor as perspective, and for that, we depend on the staff and crew of `` Saturday Night Live '' who this weekend took on the deadlocked election.
Here now a sampling.
Good evening, America.
I'm Vice President Al Gore.
And I'm the Governor of Texas, George W. Bush.
As you know, this election has been the closest in history, and the results is still in dispute.
That's right.
It's in dispute because some people do n't know when they got beat.
Like in Florida, I got 2,910,198 votes, and he got a measley 2,909,827.
Eat it, Gore.
It's also in dispute because some people in this race can not accept losing a popularity contest.
Ay if you 'll check the national popular vote, you 'll see that I Al Gore have been proven to be ipso facto, the most popular man in America.
Heck, I'm this close to having teenage girls throw their panties at me.
But listen.
We may have our differences, but I do n't want to be dividers.
We want to be unificators.
Unificators.
So a solution has been found that's both fair and consistent with the will of the American people.
We 're both going to be President.
Heck, you all did n't know who you wanted anyway.
It's true.
It's going to be great.
Hey, C.J., roll that tape.
On November 7, George W. Bush and Al Gore ran for President, but there was no clear winner, so they decided to govern together.
Could they share the White House without driving each other crazy ?
Man, that was cool.
