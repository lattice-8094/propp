Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak held coalition talks, Monday with Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon, but the two failed to agree on forming a national unity government.
A Likud official said they will meet again today.
The current explosion of violence between Palestinians and Israelis began more than three weeks ago, after Mr. Sharon visited a Jerusalem holy site.
Sporadic clashes continued, Monday in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
