Former Russian President Boris Yeltsin takes readers behind closed doors at the Kremlin in his new book.
Yeltsin writes in `` Midnight Diaries '' that he received intelligence reports about the Monica Lewinsky scandal before it went public, but he chose not to warn President Clinton.
He says he `` thought Clinton could handle it himself. ''
Yeltsin also admits he was drunk when he grabbed a baton and struck up a military orchestra in Berlin six years ago.
