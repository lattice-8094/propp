A vast area of about 60 counties in the south of Jiangxi Province and the west of Fujian province was known as the base for the Central Revolution during the period of the Agrarian Revolutionary War, and it was also called the Central Soviet Area.
From November 1927 to June 1928, with the outbreak of armed uprisings in the southwest of Jiangxi Province and the west of Fujian Province, revolutionary bases in Donggu, Qiaotou and Yongding Lake South Lane were established one after another, and the foundation for the Central Soviet Area was gradually laid.
In January 1929, Mao Zedong and Zhu De also developed revolutionary bases in the south of Jiangxi Province and the west of Fujian Province.
Later on, Red Legion No. 1 and Red Legion No. 3 joined forces, and formed the First Red Front Army.
The Red Army was growing day by day in strength.
In January 1931, the Central Bureau of the Central Soviet Area was established.
In September, after the army and people of the Central Soviet Area crushed KMT's third encirclement, the two parts to the south of Jiangxi province and the west of Fujian province were joined together and the base was expanded to more than 30 counties.
In November, the provisional central government of the Chinese Soviet Republic was formed, and Mao Zedong was the chairman.
At the same time, the Central Revolutionary Military Commission of the Chinese Soviet Republic was organized.
So far, the Central Revolutionary Base had been formally established.
In the fall of 1933, the Central Soviet Area had soviet power in four provinces including Jiangxi, Fujian, Mingan and Yuegan, with a total of 60 executive counties, and became the largest revolutionary base in the entire country.
