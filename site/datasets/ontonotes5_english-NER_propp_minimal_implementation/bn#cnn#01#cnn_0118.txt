It will likely cost more money to fix the `` USS Cole '' than was first thought.
The Navy has sent Congress a revised repair estimate of $ 240 million.
Earlier, the Navy put the figure at $ 150 million to $ 170 million.
The destroyer was damaged October in a suicide bombing in Yemen.
17 sailors were killed and 39 others injured.
The `` Cole '' is due to arrive in Mississippi in a little more than a week for repairs.
