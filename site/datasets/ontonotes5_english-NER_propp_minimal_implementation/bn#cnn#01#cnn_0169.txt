The trial of two Libyans accused of bombing Pam Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, is entering its final stage.
The trial resumed in the Netherlands today after a month-long delay.
Testimony abruptly came to a close when one of the defendants scrapped plans to take the witness stand.
Closing arguments are scheduled for tomorrow.
The two men are charged with murder and conspiracy in connection with the 1988 bombing that killed 270 people.
