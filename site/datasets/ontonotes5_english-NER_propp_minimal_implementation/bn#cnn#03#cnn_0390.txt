Back in this city, a courthouse in Manhattan.
Sam Waksal, founder and former CEO of ImClone is scheduled to be sentenced today.
He pleaded guilty earlier this year to insider trading, bank fraud and tax evasion.
Waksal could be fined $ 3.5 million, facing a maximum of 75 years in prison, expected, though, to receive about six to seven years.
That's the early indication we 've been given.
A friend of his, Martha Stewart, pleaded not guilty last week.
The charges related to her sale of ImClone stock.
She sold the share a day before bad news about the company sent the stock price falling, considerably.
Sam Waksal, sentenced, 10:00 a.m., local time here in New York.
