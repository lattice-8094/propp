In the Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Israeli soldiers fired on armed Palestinians trying to cut through a border fence.
The Army says it may have killed two of them.
ISRAELI radio said four Palestinians were killed, but Palestinian security officials deny there were any casualties and they say no such incident took place.
