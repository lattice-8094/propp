We not only need to carefully protect books and literature, but also should ensure that the natural environment is not destroyed.
In the natural world, colorful butterflies with lithe profiles have, since ancient times, been the theme for many writers and poets who had created many works with various styles.
But when it comes to using real butterflies as material, have you ever seen artistic expressions on paintings using butterflies ' wings ?
Recently, Chinese butterfly artist Mr. Wu Zequan brought his paintings of butterfly wings to Toronto, Canada, and displayed pieces of his unique works to the local community.
Let us enjoy them through the lenses of Canadian City Television.
This piece titled Longing uses a style which combines the abstract and the real, as described by Mr. Wu.
The abstract was assisted through a painting which depicts the feelings of longing of the person in the picture, and the actual images made use of various butterfly wings to manifest the beautiful costumes of the young lady.
For instance, the white shawl of the young lady was put together using common cabbage white butterflies.
