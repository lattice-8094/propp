Yugoslavia's incoming Interior Minister says he plans to put the country's former President under 24-hour surveillance.
The official notes that Slobodan Milosevic is named on a warrant from a U.N. war crimes tribunal and is under local investigation on abuse of power charges.
He says he sees no problem with Serbian police arresting Milosevic if needed.
The former President is believed to be living in Belgrade with police protection.
