The draining of a pond for anthrax evidence in Maryland is finished.
Up next for investigators, to try to search sediment on the bottom of the pond located just outside Fredrick, not far from Washington, D.C.
It's part of the investigation into the deadly anthrax attacks in the fall of 2001 in which five people were killed.
