Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is calling for an official `` timeout '' in peace talks with the Palestinians.
The decision was announced following an Israeli cabinet meeting today.
He did n't say when the time-out would begin.
The statement from Barak's office said Israel needed a timeout to `` reassess the peace process because of the continuing violence. ''
