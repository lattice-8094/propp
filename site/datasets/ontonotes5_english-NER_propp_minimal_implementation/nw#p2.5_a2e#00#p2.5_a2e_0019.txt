President Bush is now drowning in a sea of recommendations.. whose goal is to lift him out of the Iraqi quagmire that has been drowning him for 44 months : 79 recommendations from the Baker-Hamilton Commission alone, recommendations from the Pentagon, from State Department, from the National Security Council, from Congress, and a memorandum that he received very late from his former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.. All of them pushing for change, and all of them involving an implicit admission of military and political failure..
As a whole, and because of their great number, variety, overlap, and sometimes contradictions, they may cause him more confusion and distraction, and hinder his ability to choose the most realistic approach.
He now appears open to the idea of change.
But to what extent is he ready for radical change ? And in which direction ?
And who ultimately will decide the most appropriate approach ?
Is it he or his new Defense Secretary, or the military leadership, or the Congress with its Democratic majority ?
Bush has previously excluded some of the fundamental suggestions of the Baker Commission, including holding direct talks with Iran and Syria, linking the Iraqi War with the Palestinian issue, and setting a timetable for a withdrawal, as well as penalizing the Iraqi government if it fails to impose security.
And if the evaluation and assessment were to be left to him, he may not find in this report magical solutions for his Iraqi crisis, nor recommendations that convince him of a need for radical change in his Iraqi policy.
He had a previous position vis-a-vis the report as a whole, and he decided that it will not be a binding working paper.
It appears that he has a particular sensitivity towards it after it was said that the team of Bush Senior had come to rescue the Prodigal Son.
In any case, the report is a very long road map to deal with the issues of the Middle East, and is not a quick solution to stopping the violence and anarchy in Iraq.
