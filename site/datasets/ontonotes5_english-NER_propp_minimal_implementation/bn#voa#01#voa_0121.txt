Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and Syria's Foreign Minister Farookh held talks Saturday on ways of improving bilateral relations.
Mr. Aziz arrived in Damascus aboard the first direct Iraqi flight to Syria in nearly 20 years.
The flight is also reported to be the first to carry an Iraqi official out of Baghdad since the United Nations placed sanctions on Iraq 10 years ago.
