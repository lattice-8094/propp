Tell me your opinion on the Baker-Hamilton committee recommendations ?
First of all, it seems to me and as it is the fact, that the report is written for the US administration and not for the Iraqi people.
It also seems, as far as I know, that it represents recommendations and reviews rather than decisions.
The decision remains in the hands of the US administration.
And I know that much of its content does not represent the will and direction followed by the Administration.
I can also say that it set off from shaky ground, because the review was not complete in covering the entire background and its outcome after the collapse of the regime.
And it should have reviewed events more accurately, and made them into a fertile ground for a solution.
However, the report brought together contradictions in the vision and recommendations.
The vision that we find at the beginning may differ from the vision towards the end and the initial recommendations differ from the recommendations in the middle, perhaps due to it being written by multiple authors or for having a muddled vision.
But they expressed it and said there are no magic solutions.
Perhaps the reality that Iraq and the region are going through may impose itself through the difficulties encountered by those who think they are providing the solution.
But if I were asked to briefly, uh, evaluate the report, I would say that it is not lacking in good indications related to the political course and the unity of Iraq.
However, it is not devoid either of offences or negative trends regarding the Iraqi course and the review of the Iraqi crisis issue.
To us, all of these are subject to revision by the political powers to examine the positive trends and separate them from the negative trends that are not in tune with the prospects of political leaders.
