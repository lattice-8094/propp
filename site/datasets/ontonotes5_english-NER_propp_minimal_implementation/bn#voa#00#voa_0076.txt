Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called his cabinet into special session late Wednesday, to discuss what he called a grave escalation of the level of violence in the Palestinian territory.
The meeting came after three Israeli soldiers and at least two Palestinians were killed on the West Bank.
In Washington, acting Israeli Foreign Minister Shalome Ben-Ami called the situation extremely grave.
, let us call it a war or if you prefer, a mini war.
So, this is a war in many senses and the Palestinians are shooting at our soldiers, and therefore we need to address this issue not as a civilian uprising, but as a military confrontation.
At least 160 people have been killed in the past five weeks, most of them Palestinians.
