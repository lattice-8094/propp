One of the largest cases of alleged sexual abuse by a Catholic priest is being settled.
The archdiocese of Portland has apologized to 22 men who say they were molested by an Oregon priest when they were altar boys.
Jeff Brady reports from Oregon Public Broadcasting.
The men say they were abused by Maurice Grammond as far back as 50 years ago.
As part of the settlement, the men will receive money though the exact amount is being kept confidential.
The agreement also calls for an apology from the Portland Archdiocese that will be read from the pulpit of every parish in Western Oregon at Sunday Mass.
Attorney David Slater represented the alleged victims.
These men were burdened through their childhood, and into adulthood, and even in the middle age with an overwhelming sense of shame and isolation.
With few exceptions they kept this experience and the shame around it a secret even from their own wives.
Maurice Grammond is now 80 and lives in the Alzheimer's unit of a nursing home.
He never faced criminal charges for the alleged abuse because the statute of limitations expired long ago.
