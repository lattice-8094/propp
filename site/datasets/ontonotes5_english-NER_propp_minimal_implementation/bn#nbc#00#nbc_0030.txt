The nation's highest court will take up the case next week.
That development may not be as significant as it seems.
Joining me now is law professor Rick Pildes, a consultant to NBC News.
Could a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court settle this case once and for all ?
At this stage, any decision from the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certainly not going to provide a final resolution of this election dispute.
Indeed, the issue is so narrow now before the Supreme Court that whichever way the court rules, it will likely have only the most marginal impact on what's going on in Florida.
Even if the Bush campaign prevails before the Supreme Court, it simply means we will move more quickly into the contest phase of the litigation or the next stage of the litigation.
But you believe the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court just decided to hear this case is a partial victory for both Bush and Gore.
It is a partial victory for both sides.
For the last two weeks, the central constitutional argument the Bush campaign has been making to the federal courts is, stop these manual recounts now, they violate the Constitution.
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear that part of the case, agreeing with all the other federal judges who have unanimously held that this is not the proper time for federal court intervention.
So in that sense, a victory for the Gore campaign.
For the Bush campaign, a victory in the willingness of the Supreme Court to play some role in overseeing the Florida system and the Florida judicial decision making process.
Whatever the Supreme Court decides this time, you say this case could come back before the U.S. Supreme Court again ?
John, if the Supreme Court of the United States is to play a final and decisive role in this dispute, that role is going to come at the end of the Florida judicial process, not at this stage.
Law professor Rick Pildes, thank you.
