Thank you and Goodday.
More deadly violence has erupted in the West Bank as Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Barak failed to form a government of national unity.
As night fell Monday, in the town of Hebron, one Palestinian man was shot dead in an exchange of fire between Palestinian militiamen and Israeli soldiers.
There were also gun battles near Jerusalem.
About 130 people have been killed in more than three weeks of violence, almost all Palestinians.
Monday, Mr. Barak met with Israel's right wing Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon, to form an emergency unity government to deal with the crisis, but Likud says the two failed to agree on terms.
Middle East expert Mark Gulpan, of Tufts University, says Israel's fragile coalition politics may stand in the way.
Well, they have made deals with Likud before and Likud is not completely just Sharon, there are moderates within Likud.
So, I think they are capable of making deals with them and that's not really the problem.
The problem is that the coalition may prevent any possibility of creating a real agreement.
Palestinians have said they will not work with Mr. Sharon, and here in US, Clinton administration spokesman Jake Sewart says the President is still hard at work trying to find a solution for the Middle East crisis.
He has continued to consult with both parties and with leaders in the that we can to try to get the parties to agree on and to move forward on the agreement we reached in Egypt.
