A new project encouraging rooftop gardens in Chicago is bringing new meaning to the term `` urban jungle. ''
The roof of City Hall is being transformed into an urban oasis.
Rooftops normally absorb the hot sun and heat up the air in cities which can make pollution worse.
The project is part of a federal government study to see if rooftop gardens can have the opposite effect.
