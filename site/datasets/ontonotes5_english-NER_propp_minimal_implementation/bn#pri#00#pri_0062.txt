In China a campaign against fake goods has netted 43 million dollars of counterfeit products over the past month.
The trade in bogus goods is thought to cost companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenues each year, but officials say enforcing the law is often dangerous with at least one government inspector killed in recent weeks.
Officials say some corrupt local government officials are protecting the pirates.

Multinational companies investing in China had become so angry that they recently set up an anti-piracy league in Beijing to pressure the Chinese government to take action.
Domestic manufacturers, who are also suffering, launched a similar body this month.
China recently introduced a new law increasing fines against producers of fake goods from the amount of profit made to the value of the goods produced, but many observers say this is still not a sufficient deterrent.
Chinese media have said that fake products are humiliating the nation and undermining public morality, and while the fakes are often so well packaged that even the real manufacturers ca n't tell the difference, the products inside are often downright dangerous.
China says it is determined to tackle the problem as part of its moves towards joining the World Trade Organization.
