Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will resume peace talks today after a delay caused by the abduction and killing of a Jewish settler in Gaza.
A senior Palestinian negotiator says the session will be a follow-up to one held Saturday to discuss a set of peace compromises proposed by President Clinton.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak described Sunday's killing as a serious blow to the peace process.
He called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to put an end to acts of violence, saying they do not serve any party.
