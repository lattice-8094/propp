Let us look at this picture first.
This picture, ah, was published on the front cover of Nature Magazine printed on the 14th.
The animals in this picture, uh, perhaps you may not be very familiar with.
It's called Volaticotherium antiquus, Gu as in Gudai, and Xiang as in Fei Xiang.
It was discovered by five Chinese scientists regularly stationed in both China and the United States during an archaeological expedition at the end of last year.
Of course, this picture, uh, was also drawn based on the recovered portrait of the fossil.
The World Journal said that the meaning of the discovery of Volaticotherium antiquus is of great significance.
By now, the earliest known mammal gliders are bats, which had started to exist about 51 million years ago.
But Volaticotherium antiquus, uh, may have lived between 130 million to 160 million years ago, during the same time period as the dinosaurs.
Its discovery, ah, pushed the origins of mammal gliders back at least 80 million years.
