According to what the human rights organizations reveal, a Chinese scholar of the Chinese Academy of Social Studies, Lu Jianhua, who was involved in the case of Hong Kong senior reporter Ching Cheong, was secretly tried and sentenced to 20 years by the authorities.
But Lu Jianhua's family had no knowledge at all about this trial.
Hong Kong legal expert Wong Yau-Gumm pointed out that the verdict was unfair.
He said, As an accomplice, Lu Jianhua was singularly and heavily sentenced to 20 years ; it is believed that the CPC wants to use this opportunity to discipline officials within the system.
Please watch the detailed report.
Headquartered in Hong Kong, China Human Rights Information Center disclosed on Tuesday that Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court secretly sentenced Lu Jianhua to 20 years in prison for leaking state secrets.
It is understood that so far Lu Jianhua had not pleaded guilty, neither had he hired a defense lawyer.
The officials have not released the contents of the verdict either.
Lu Jianhua's wife, Madam Qu, verified the information only after she had called the court.
She said she will lodge an appeal.
Hong Kong legal expert Wang Jin, who is familiar with mainland Chinese laws, believed that the authorities sentenced excessively heavily on Lu Jianhua ; one reason was that Lu Jianhua is a citizen of mainland China, and the other reason is that the authorities wanted to severely discipline people within the system with this opportunity.
