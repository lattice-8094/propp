Filipino officials said about four hundred people died in landslide resulting from Hurricane Durian, south of the capital, Manila.
Officials added that hundreds of people are still missing and the final outcome is expected to increase.
With wind speed that reached about two hundred and sixty kilometers per hour, Hurricane Durian hit the northern Philippines.
The hurricane, accompanied by heavy rains, led to uprooting trees, cutting roads and landslides.
Several villages south of the capital, Manila, were buried in mud and rocks.
Hurricane Durian, known as the Fruit of Asia to the local residents, is only one degree less than the strongest hurricanes, classified as Category Five.
The dead and injured as a result of the landslides are expected to increase in view of the difficulty in reaching those afflicted.
We expect big numbers of residents will be harmed by the hurricane and we are in need of medicine and relief materials, in addition to heavy machinery to clean the streets.
The Philippine capital, Manila, is no longer the next stop for Hurricane Durian, as it was expected, and in spite of that, the government asked the twelve million residents of the capital to be fully prepared to welcome heavy rains and strong winds.
Durian is expected to reach the Vietnamese coasts in the coming few days.
But meteorologists say the hurricane will lose its strength and turn into a tropical storm while it passes the South China Sea.
This hurricane is the fourth to hit the Philippines in three months, causing huge losses in lives and property.
More than two hundred people died during last September, when Hurricane Xangsane hit the north of the country.
Economic experts say the growth of the Philippine economy dropped noticeably during the third quarter of this year because of the wave of hurricanes.
