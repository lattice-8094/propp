The Iranian delegate to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries-LRB-OPEC-RRB-, Kazempour Ardebili, called on Sunday for a new cut in the organization's production at its next meeting on December 14.
Ardebili said that " certain factors such as slow international growth and an increase in crude oil reserves and derivative products indicate that the market needs a new cut in OPEC's production. "
The organization had decided on October 20 to lower its production ceiling to support oil prices, while some of its members recommended examining the impact of this decision before considering a new cut in production.
But Ardebili noted that " the supply is still greater than the market demand, even with the organization's latest cuts, and the market's demands have all been met. "
OPEC's Acting Secretary General, Mohammed Barkindo, said on November 20 that it is imperative to wait " at least one month " before assessing the impact of the decision taken by the organization in October to cut production by 1.2 million barrels a day.
OPEC will convene a new meeting on December 14 in Abuja, Nigeria, to examine the first assessment of the results of this production cut.
Several member states in the organization, specifically the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria and Qatar expressed their support during the meeting for a cut in production in case prices continue to decline.
