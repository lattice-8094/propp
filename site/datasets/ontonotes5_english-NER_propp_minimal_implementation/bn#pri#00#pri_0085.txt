President Clinton was back in Ireland today during the first leg of a 3-day trip that will also take him to Belfast and London.
He is looking ways to encourage the peace process in Northern Ireland.
NPR's Marianne McGuire reports from Belfast.
After shopping in Dublin and drinking a pint of Guinness in a pub, President Clinton traveled to the Irish border for an evening ceremony.
More than 60,000 people parked the square in the center of Dundalk, a border town.
In a carnival atmosphere, people from north and south of the island thanked the President for his efforts in the peace process.
Mr. Clinton appealed to them to continue supporting the peace accords.
And I ask you stand up for peace today, tomorrow, and the rest of your lives.
But many problems remain in the peace process.
The President will discuss such issues Wednesday when he meets the key players of the peace accord in Belfast.
