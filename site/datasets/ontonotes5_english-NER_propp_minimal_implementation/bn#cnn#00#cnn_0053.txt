The bodies of the final four sailors recovered from the `` USS Cole '' are returning home today.
A plane carrying the remains is due to arrive at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware later this morning.
A brief ceremony will be held afterward.
17 sailors were killed in the apparent terrorist attack at a port in Yemen ten days ago.
