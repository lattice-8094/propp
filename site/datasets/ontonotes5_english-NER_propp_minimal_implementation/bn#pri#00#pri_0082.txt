The Israeli Army has imposed a complete blockade of the part of the West Bank under the control of the Palestinian Authority.
No entry to or exit from the territory is to be allowed except for humanitarian cases.
The move comes at the end of a day of intense violence across the West Bank in which 10 people were killed, 7 Palestinians and 3 Israelis.
