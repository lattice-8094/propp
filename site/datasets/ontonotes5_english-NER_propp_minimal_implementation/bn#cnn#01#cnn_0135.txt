Yemen's President says his country's constitution wo n't allow any suspects in the bombing of the `` USS Cole '' to be extradited.
He tells `` the Washington Post '' authorities are still searching for the suspected mastermind behind the attack, but he would n't speculate if suspected terrorist Osama Bin Laden was involved.
Next month, Yemen plans to try six suspects in the October suicide bombing that killed 17 U.S. sailors.
