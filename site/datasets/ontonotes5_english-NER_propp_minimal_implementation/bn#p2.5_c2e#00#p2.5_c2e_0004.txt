It's close to year end, and car manufacturers and dealers have one by one fired off their last round of price wars for this year.
In Beijing's auto market, the reduction levels of some medium-grade cars even reached as much as 30,000 Yuan.
Compared to the situation of price reductions in previous years, it is neither the relatively price-sensitive economic car models nor the slow-selling cars that are leading the wave of price cuts at this year-end ; rather the medium-grade cars have become the main force of this year's price reductions.
Like this Honda Fit behind me, two days ago it was priced at 116,800 Yuan, but today it is selling for only 92,800 Yuan.
A discount of 24,000 is very attractive, and in the time of merely half an hour, this dealer sold two Honda Fit cars.
Considering the prices, uh, people feel that a discount of over 20,000 Yuan in this period is quite appropriate.
It is understood that till now, over 50 car models with domestic brands have reduced their prices at the same time.
Among these, the reduction rate is larger for smaller and mid-sized cars, such as Honda City, Toyota Vios, Hyundai Accent, Chevy Lova, Honda Fit, Hyundai Elantra, Hyundai Sonata, Toyota Crown, and Honda Accord, where price reductions ranged from about 10 percent to 20 percent.
Once at the year-end, in order to receive higher return points from the auto manufacturers, car dealers will all aim at higher annual total sales.
This is also the main reason why car prices have all dropped at the end of the year.
If you want to buy a car, eh, this is the time, ah, to shop around a little bit more.
