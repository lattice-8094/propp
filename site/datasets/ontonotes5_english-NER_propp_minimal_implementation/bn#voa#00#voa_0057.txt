In the Gaza Strip Thursday, a young Palestinian on a bicycle wearing a black bag stuffed with explosives rammed an Israeli Army bunker killing himself and wounding one Israeli soldier.
The militant Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack, the first suicide bombing during a month of clashes between Palestinian rioters and Israeli security forces.
