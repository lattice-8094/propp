Meanwhile Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami in Cairo, but no breakthroughs toward a peace deal were reported.
The meeting, which lasted about two hours, followed Cairo talks earlier Wednesday between Mr. Ben-Ami and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have been trying to revive the peace process and reduce Israeli-Palestinian violence that has killed more than 365 people since late September.
