The British House of Lords is looking into the case that Hello! magazine filed against Ok! magazine in the struggle over the publishing of the wedding photos of actors Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas.
The administration of Ok! magazine succeeded in moving the case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeals ruled that it did not have the right to sue the competitor magazine for causing damage to its commercial interests and that it should pay two million dollars in compensation for the damages it suffered, according to the BBC announcement yesterday, Tuesday.
The Court of First Instance in London had granted Ok! magazine one million pounds sterling in compensation in November 2003, but the competitor magazine appealed the judgment and admitted that it had taken the pictures in order to ruin Ok! magazine's exclusive coverage of the wedding that took place in the Plaza Hotel in New York in November 2000.
Hello! said in the Court of Appeals that spoiler photos are a common strategy in the media, which are used to ruin exclusive coverage of competitor magazines, a justification that the court accepted and accordingly ordered Ok! magazine to pay for the damages produced by the case, trial, and other costs, amounting to two million pounds.
