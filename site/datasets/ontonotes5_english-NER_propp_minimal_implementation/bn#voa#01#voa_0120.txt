Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic won a landslide victory Saturday as he was re-elected leader of the Socialist Party of Serbia.
A defiant Mr. Milosevic made his first public appearance since being deposed in a popular uprising last month.
He told the SPS conference in Belgrade, those who sought his downfall are traitors and agents of Western countries.
