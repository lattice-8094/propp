Lawyers for the two Libyans charged with the Lockerbie airliner bombing say they will call no further witnesses, abruptly ending testimony in the trial.
They closed their case after failing to obtain what they say is crucial evidence from Syria.
The BBC's Andrew Castle reports.
In an unexpected turn of events, defense lawyers told the trial judges that after calling three witnesses, no further evidence will be led on behalf of one of the accused Libyans, Abdul Basit Ali Mohammad Almed Grahi and none at all introduced for the other, Alamin Khaleefa Fima.
As a result, neither of the accused will take the stand to give evidence.
The development follows the refusal by Syria to cooperate with efforts by the court to recover information regarded by defense lawyers as crucial to their case, that the bombing was carried out by militant Palestinians, some of whom were members of an organization with links to Syria.
