At the request of the Huang family, the court conducted a judicial assessment of this will.
The conclusion was that the will was written by Xu Changlin, but no conclusion could be made as to when Huang Zhuqin's stamp was affixed.
On August 3, 2006, Shanghai Xuhui District Court made a judgment as the court of first instance.
Since the first three wills were respectively written on November 21, 1994, August 17, 1998, and February 24, 1999, while the fourth will was written on September 15, 1999, at a time after those three wills, the court therefore decided that Xu Changlin's fourth will should prevail according to the law.
However, the fourth will could only reflect Xu Changlin's opinions on the disposition of the estate under his own name.
Meanwhile, Huang Zhuqin's family letter in October 2004 reflected her pre-death wish to dispose of the estate by herself.
Since Huang Zhuqin did not leave any will, the residential unit on Xietu Road, a property allocated to Huang Zhuqin, should be inherited by her heirs according to the legal process.
The court ruled that the property right of the Room 207 residential unit at 2899 Xietu Road, Shanghai, under the name of Huang Zhuqin, the inherited, should be awarded to plaintiffs Xu Yongxiang and Xu Rulun and defendant Xu Changqing, with each entitled to one-third ownership.
Plaintiffs and defendants shall pay the third parties Huang Songling, Huang Zhiling, and Huang Meiling the pro rata value of the property at 133,000 yuan each.
