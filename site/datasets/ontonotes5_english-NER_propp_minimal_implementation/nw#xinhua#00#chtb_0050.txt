Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 16, by wire-LRB-reporter Fang Zhou-RRB--
The investment of foreign capital in agriculture in Jiangsu province is increasing daily.
To date, the number of projects with direct foreign investment in agriculture in Jiangsu province has reached 800, with a sum of money of more than 800 million US dollars.
An official from the Jiangsu Agriculture and Forestry Department said that, since 1994 the number of " three-capital " enterprises that have been approved by the agricultural system of Jiangsu province has exceeded 500, and the amount of foreign capital being put to use was more than 700 million US dollars, which represented threefold and sevenfold increases, respectively, over the years before 1993.
The foreign investment increase from the US, Japan and Singapore was comparatively larger.
The proportion of foreign investment in the new projects is growing larger and larger and the number of exclusively foreign-owned enterprises has markedly increased.
The rapid increase in foreign investment has, to a certain extent, made up for investment shortfalls in agriculture in Jiangsu province and has expedited the development and utilization of agricultural resources.
According to statistics, currently in Jiangsu province the enterprises for processing agricultural and allied products that have output values exceeding 100 million yuan RMB already number more than 100.
Using a loan from the Japanese government and the direct investment of foreign companies, the Lianyugang Ruyi Group has built a vegetable processing and marketing enterprise that is the largest in export volume and has the greatest variety in China at present.
Using foreign investment, Jiangsu has also introduced nearly 100 varieties of fine produce such as beer barley, California perch, Luoshi pond shrimp, fine poultry, lean meat pigs and vegetables, and flowers and plants, along with advanced production and processing technology, and it has substantially raised agricultural production levels.
