The US Iraq Study Group's report on the 6th made 79 recommendations to the Bush administration on its Iraq policy.
There are two key recommendations.
One is to urge the Bush administration to launch a new diplomatic offensive in the Middle East and Gulf, in particular, to hold talks with Iran and Syria on the resolution to the Iraqi sectarian conflicts.
The second is to change the primary tasks of the US military in Iraq and gradually withdraw the military from Iraq if conditions permit.
This study report says the situation in Iraq is very grave and deteriorating.
However, it is very careful in wording when making proposals and appears ambiguous at critical points.
For example, the report even just briefly touches on military withdrawal, an issue of the most concern.
If nothing unexpected will have happened in the security situation by March 2008, the primary task of the US military in Iraq should be shifted to supporting the Iraqi military that assumes main military operations.
All the unnecessary combat troops will leave Iraq.
Some analyses think that this shows, on one hand, that the study group did not want to confront the Bush administration on this key and sensitive issue of military withdrawal, and on the other hand, it also shows that amidst the current mess in Iraq, both Republicans and Democrats find it very hard to come up with an effective and sure-fire proposal and action plan.
So, many Iraqis think this report is rather of little practical significance.
