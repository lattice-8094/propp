In the first hours of dawn yesterday, the US Congress adopted the final draft of a proposed bill to isolate Hamas by preventing the United States from helping the Palestinian Authority as long as Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist and does not reject violence.
The bill, which was prepared by the Senate and adopted by the Congress in a show-of-hands vote, also requires that Hamas recognize the peace agreements that were signed between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and prohibits the granting of entrance visas to members of the Palestinian Authority as long as Hamas continues to lead the government and does not accept these requirments.
But the bill, which is now ready for American President George Bush to sign, allows for the continuation of humanitarian aid-food, water, and medicine-and the aid which allows Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas-Abu Mazen-to perform his duties.
The bill represents a slightly modified version of a bill voted on by the Senate which had raised objections by the Administration, and it allows the Administration to rally around the ban Congress has imposed in the name of national security of the United States.
During Friday prayers in Tehran, Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya renewed Hamas ' declaration that it will not recognize Israel.
He confirmed that the Palestinian movement will continue on the road of resistance until the occupied city of Jerusalem has been liberated.
He added that the international community and Israel are asking us to recognize the theft of our land, to stop jihad and resistance, and to respect previously signed agreements, confirming that these things will never happen.
