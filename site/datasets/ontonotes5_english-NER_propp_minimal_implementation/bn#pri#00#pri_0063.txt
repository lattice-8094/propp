GOP vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney celebrated Thanksgiving in a Washington D.C. hospital where he is recovering from what doctors said was a mild heart attack.
Cheney got a telephone call from his democratic counterpart Joseph Lieberman wishing him a speedy recovery.
The hospital spokeswoman said that Cheney could go home as early as tomorrow if his recovery continues to go well.
