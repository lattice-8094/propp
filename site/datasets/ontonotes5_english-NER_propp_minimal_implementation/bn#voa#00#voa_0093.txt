Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is heading to Washington for talks today with President Clinton as deadly clashes continue in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Mr. Barak says expectations are low for a quick end to the six weeks of violence.
Mr. Clinton met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday.
Meanwhile, six more Palestinians and another Israeli soldier have been killed in the latest violence.
