Israel has fired on offices of the Palestinian Authority injuring 62 people.
The Israeli Army says it's retaliation for a bomb attack on an Israeli school bus in the occupied Gaza Strip.
NPR's Jennifer Laden reports from Jerusalem.
Israeli helicopter gun ships fired across the Gaza Strip for more than two hours, hitting the offices of the Palestinian police, security services and Yasser Arafat's political party, Fatah.
Israeli defense officials accused Fatah of carrying out the bus attack.
Though provided no evidence, Fatah officials denied the link.
The bus bombing killed two Jewish settlers including a schoolteacher and also wounded nine others, including several children.
A brother and sister had to have parts of their legs and feet amputated.
Angry settlers gathered around the bus with its melon-sized holes, denouncing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for exercising too much restraint, but Palestinians warned that the missile attacks in Gaza would dangerously escalate their two-month-old conflict.

Elsewhere, a Palestinian was killed in clashes that erupted in Gaza hours after the bomb attack.
