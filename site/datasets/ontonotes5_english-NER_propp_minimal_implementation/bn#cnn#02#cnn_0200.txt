In northern Iraq, U.S. warplanes hit targets including a ridge east of Mosul, where Iraqi troops have been entrenched.
Two F Tomcats struck the targets.
The same area was a site of heavy bombing yesterday.
After today's air strikes, 13 Iraqi soldiers abandoned their posts and surrendered to Kurdish fighters.
