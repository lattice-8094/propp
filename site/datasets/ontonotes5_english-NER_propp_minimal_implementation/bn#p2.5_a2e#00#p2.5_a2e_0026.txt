The surprise victory of the leftist candidate Rafael Correa in the run-off presidential elections in Ecuador recalled the rise of the leftist tide in many countries in the Latin American states region.
The victory of Correa, who is the eighth president of Ecuador in ten years, will strengthen the campaign of his ally, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who aims at establishing an alliance of the leftist governments facing the American influence in the region.
The initial results that have been announced confirmed that Rafael Correa received sixty-eight percent of the total votes versus thirty-one percent for his competitor, the rightist candidate Alvaro Noboa, who had won the majority of votes in the first round of the elections.
While supporters of Correa started to celebrate the victory in different areas of Ecuador, Alvaro Noboa, the richest man in the country, who is seeking to win the presidency position for the third time, questioned the accuracy of these results.
The winning candidate, Rafael Correa, who preceded the announcement of the final results, renewed his intention to call for forming a constitutional association that enjoys full authority, and opposed the currently stalled negotiations for reaching a free trade agreement with the United States.
The winning president in these elections faces a difficult challenge to his ability to govern Ecuador for the next four years, as it is a politically unstable country that has overthrown many presidents : the last of them was Lucio Gutierrez, who dissolved the Supreme Court and appointed new judges who cancelled an arrest warrant against a former president accused of corruption.
