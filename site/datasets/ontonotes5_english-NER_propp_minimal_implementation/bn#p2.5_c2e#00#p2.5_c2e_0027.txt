Let's take a look at South Korea again.
Reporters have been waiting for an entire day at the South Korean Press Center, but the head of the delegation Chun Yung-Woo had still not appeared.
At 6:30 in the evening, the deputy head of South Korean delegation, in place of Chun Yung-woo, finally arrived in a hurry.
However, the press briefing room was only open to Korean reporters.
China's Central Television, Xinhua News Agency, as well as Reuters, Japan's NHK, and many other media were all kept outside the gate.
The internal exchanges exclusively enjoyed by South Korean reporters lasted 15 minutes.
Soon after, South Korea's deputy head, who did not want to disclose his name nor face to the cameras, briefly reported on today's meeting to these reporters who had been waiting outside for a long time.
He said that apart from Japan, presently, North Korea had already conducted bilateral consultations with all other four countries.
The talks between North Korea and the U.S., which have attracted much attention, were conducted in a harmonious manner, but no new proposals were raised, nor were there concrete measures on the abandonment of North Korea's nuclear program.
It is estimated that the two countries will continue to discuss the U.S. financial sanctions on North Korea tomorrow. And that this round of six-party talks may conclude before Christmas.
Last night, the head of Japanese the six-party talks delegation Kenichiro Sasae noted that the results of the talks in the second day were not optimistic, and were in fact quite a distance from the expected results of the talks for all the participating countries.
