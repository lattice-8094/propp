Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is proposing an interim peace deal with the Palestinians.
The proposal would give the Palestinians a state and 10 % more land, but it would put off decisions on the fate of Jerusalem.
Barak announced the proposition in a speech to newspaper editors.
Palestinian officials say they have not formally received it, but they add they oppose any interim agreement.
