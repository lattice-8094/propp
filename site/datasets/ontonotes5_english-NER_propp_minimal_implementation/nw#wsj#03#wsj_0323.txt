Bouygues S.A., a diversified construction concern based in Paris, said its consolidated profit for the 1989 first half, after payments to minority interests, surged to 188 million French francs-LRB-$ 30.2 million-RRB-from 65 million francs a year earlier.
Revenue rose 21 % to 22.61 billion francs from 18.69 billion francs.
The company did n't specify reasons for the strong earnings gain.
But Bouygues said its first-half profit is n't indicative of the full-year trend because of the highly seasonal nature of many of the company's activities.
For all of 1988, Bouygues had consolidated profit of 519 million francs, after payments to minority interests, on revenue of 50 billion francs.
The group has forecast 1989 revenue of 56.9 billion francs.
