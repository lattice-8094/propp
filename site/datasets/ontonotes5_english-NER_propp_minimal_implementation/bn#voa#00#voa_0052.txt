United Nation's Secretary General Kofi Annan Wednesday announced two high level appointments.
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations.
Mr. Annan chose Rudd Lubbers as the next UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Mr. Lubbers, former Prime Minister of the Netherlands will replace Cidako Ogada of Japan, who is retiring.
Mr. Lubbers will direct a huge UN agency with a more than one billion dollar annual budget and operations in 120 countries.
One major issue Mr. Lubbers will have to face is the problem of people who have fled their homes but remain in their own countries.
Such so-called internally displaced people are not now covered by the mandate of the High Commissioner for Refugees, but there is pressure to change that.
Secretary General Annan also named Faraya Ogade as the new head of the UN Population Fund, an agency that provides reproductive health and family planning assistance around the world.
