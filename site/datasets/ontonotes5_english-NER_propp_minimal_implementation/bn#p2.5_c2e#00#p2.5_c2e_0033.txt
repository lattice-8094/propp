For many overseas immigrants, becoming a citizen is a matter of great concern.
And passing the citizenship examination is one of the hurdles they must overcome.
Recently, ah, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has changed the format of their citizenship exams.
This decision has increased the difficulties of Chinese becoming U.S. citizens, and has resulted in quite some repercussions among the Chinese community.
Let us look at a report from the American Chinese-language television.
After the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced the questions for the new citizenship exam, there were mixed reactions within the Chinese communities, in particular from some of the elderly who wished to become citizens.
Some felt that it would be more difficult to become naturalized citizens from now on.
Some citizenship classes are also forced to update their existing curricula.
It is generally believed that the revised naturalization questions will increase the difficulty of the exam.
Currently, most of the questions only require simple answers to be satisfactory.
However, from the known portions of the new exam questions, future exams will assess naturalization applicants ' knowledge in areas like American social and political history ; and applicants need to extend and elaborate their answers.
For instance, current applicants only need to know that the structure of the U.S. government is a separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, but future applicants will need to answer why there is a need for such a separation of powers.
So for those who do not have a good command of English, they will usually find it more difficult.
