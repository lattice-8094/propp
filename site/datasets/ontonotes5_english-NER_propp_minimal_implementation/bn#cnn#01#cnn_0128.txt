It's probably the most-watched vehicle since the O.J. Simpson chase, and now it can be yours, for enough money.
The Ryder rental truck which carried Palm Beach County's ballots to Tallahassee is up for auction on the internet.
Budget Group, which owns Ryder, says it received numerous offers, but decided to auction the truck online, with the net proceeds going to the American Red Cross.
So it's a good cause.
The bidding was at $ 21,900 this morning, and will be open for a week.
