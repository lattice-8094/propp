President Salim Al-Hoss appealed to opposition leaders on the eve of the protests they called for in Beirut to " fully preserve order in any demonstration and to move calmly and to maintain a civilized manner of expression ".
The Lebanon News Agency asked him for his predictions on how matters might unfold to which he replied, " I am convinced that those who claim they are the decision makers no longer make the decisions ; it is in the grip of external parties.
We regret that any movement, contact or dialog is futile.
We have to wait for the understanding that America will reach with Iraq's two neighbors, Iran and Syria, for the situation in Lebanon to be resolved.
Until then, the American project in the region is constructive chaos, starting in Iraq and passing through to Lebanon ".
Elsewhere, Al-Hoss expressed his full appreciation and thanks to those who rejected the attack on him and supported and empathized with him.
He said that he was over the incident and called on those who said unbecoming things about him to meet with him.
He expressed his wish to talk to them to understand their misgivings, complaints and objections, and to hear his view on all this.
