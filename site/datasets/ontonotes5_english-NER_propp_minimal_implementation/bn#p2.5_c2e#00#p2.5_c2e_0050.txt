George is an eight-year-old boy who lives in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia.
On the day of November 23, his supporters gathered in the city.
This day he tried to push a truck with his bare hands at the age of eight to break a Guinness World Record.
George looks somewhat older than his real age.
The simple reason is that his physique appears stronger than other children of the same age.
At eight years old, he already weighs 93 kilograms and is 150 centimeters tall.
Little George's parents and relatives encourage him to take advantage of the gifts which he naturally possesses to make himself a famous person.
He easily challenged the 43-meter distance and broke the Guinness World Record.
This achievement made his father very happy.
He said, I'm very happy that my child has broken the Guinness World Record.
I'm overjoyed.
Today is St. George's Day.
My son George broke the Guinness world record on this day.
St. George is a faction from the Eastern Orthodox Church.
The Guinness World Record committee were looking for a volunteer to sign up to participate in the 500 kilograms challenge at first.
George prepared to break the record under his father's guidance.
When he had gotten everything ready, the truck had already been loaded to 2,100 kilograms.
This was enough to break the record.
The doctor who had been looking after George since he was small until he grew up said that although his body size was bigger and he was stronger than normal, overall he was very healthy.
