In Miami today the trial of five men accused of being spies for Fidel Castro got underway.
Prosecutors say the men ran a sophisticated eavesdropping operation.
It served as the Cuban government's eyes and ears in South Florida.
In Havana Cuban television took little note of this development.
It was busy celebrating the 7th birthday today of a certain little boy named Elian.
Last night Cubans retreated to never-before seen footage of Elian Gonzalez's first encounter with President Fidel Castro.
The scene was filmed five months ago, shortly after the shipwreck victim returned to Cuba following a heated international custody battle.
He 'd spent 7 months in the home of Miami relatives who tried to prevent the boy's return, but on that day last summer Elian was indeed as far from Miami as you can get.
The scene shows Fidel Castro in his traditional olive green uniform presenting the boy with a gift, a children's book written by Cuban independence hero Jose Marti.
As Elian looks up speechlessly, Castro tells him to take care of the book because he will enjoy it for the rest of his life.
At one point Castro leans over and kisses the boy on the hand.
A year ago today, Elian was celebrating his birthday in the United States being showered with gifts by his Florida relatives and very much in the media spotlight.
By contrast Castro has strictly limited the media's access to the boy, but that policy seems to have changed now with foreign reporters invited to attend Elian's birthday party today in his hometown of Cardinas, Cuba.
