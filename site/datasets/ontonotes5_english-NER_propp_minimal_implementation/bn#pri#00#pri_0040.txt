Clashes between Israeli Army units and Palestinians have continued into the night.
That's after another day of violence in which four Palestinians were killed.
Helicopter gunships were deployed around the West Bank village of Bagella.
Exchanges of fire between Israelis and Palestinians have also been reported around Jericho, Greg Barrow reports.
A day of violence across the West Bank and Gaza has been followed by more clashes after nightfall.
Houses in the West Bank village of Bagella have been attached by Israeli helicopter gunships.
An Israeli military spokesman said they were deployed in response to gun fire from Palestinians inside Bagella, which was aimed at the Jewish settlement of Kilo.
The Israelis say the helicopters went into action firing machine guns, but unconfirmed reports from inside Bagella suggested rockets may have been used.
