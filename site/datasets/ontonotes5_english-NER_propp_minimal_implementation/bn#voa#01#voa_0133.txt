The United Nations has launched another major appeal for aid for countries facing critical food shortages such as North Korea, Afghanistan and Angola.
The world body says North Korea will need more food in the year 2001, because of crop devastation brought on by drought at planting time and typhoons that severely damaged the fall harvest.
The United Nations is also appealing for $ 229 million from international donors to help Afghanistan, a country shattered by years of war and the worst drought in three decades.
For Angola, the United Nations is appealing for $ 202 million in food aid.
