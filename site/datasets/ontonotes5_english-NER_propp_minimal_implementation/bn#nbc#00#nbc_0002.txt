In Canada today, they were mourning the death of one of that country's most important and charismatic leaders, Pierre Elliot Trudeau.
A state funeral at Montreal's Notre Dame Basilica attended by dozens of foreign dignitaries, including former President Jimmy Carter and Fidel Castro, who Trudeau supported during the Cold War.
The former Prime Minister's son Justin told the nearly 3,000 mourners and the millions watching on TV to carry on his father's dream of a united Canada.
Pierre Trudeau died last Thursday, at the age of 80.
