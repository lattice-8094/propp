Ice Icicle has appeared in large areas of Turks River, Ili, Xinjiang, since last month.
The ice icicle section is more than eight kilometers in length.
At some bending river, the ice icicle sediment has piled up and caused blocking to the river.
The stream water has overflown the riverbanks and flooded into the nearby houses of herders.
After the disaster occurred, the local government quickly organized for the herders along the river to evacuate.
At present 146 families with over 840 herding folks are moving to newly built earthquake-resistant safe houses.
Gradually, 18,000 heads of livestock will also be moved to winter pastures.
Turks County has also organized emergency personnel to be on 24-hour ice icicle prevention duty so to deal with any new dangers that might arise.
To remove the threat that the ice icicle caused to the local herders, the local government has invested over five million yuan in building 129 new houses in Kalatuohai Township, which are being used to settle the herders under threat from the ice icicle.
Turks River is a main branch of Ili River and joins Kashi River and Gong Naisi River, making Ili River the biggest river by volume of water in Xinjiang.
Last year, in the middle of December, an ice icicle flooding once occured in Turks River, which had not been seen for fifty years.
The ice icicle flooding that occurred this time is a full month earlier than last year.
