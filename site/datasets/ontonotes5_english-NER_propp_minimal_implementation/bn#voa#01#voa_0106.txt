Cuban President Fidel Castro is accusing US-based Cuban exiles of plotting to kill him during the summit meeting this weekend in Panama.
Mr. Castro told reporters in Panama City, the Miami-based Cuban-American Foundation has sent assassins to the Panamanian capital to eliminate him during the summit.
Foundation officials called Mr. Castro's accusations absurd.
