President Clinton has reached a deal with independent prosecutor Robert Ray to avoid indictment after leaving office.
In a statement Friday, Mr. Clinton admitted he did not fully tell the truth when he gave testimony about his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
He admitted false statements were made when he was questioned in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
His lawyer David Kendall insists that Mr. Clinton is not guilty of perjury or obstruction of justice.
He has from the beginning, at least from the Grand Jury, conceded that he tried to conceal the relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
He tried to conceal that and we 've acknowledged that that was evasive and misleading, but it's not obstruction of justice, it's not intentional falsification.
In return for the admission the prosecutor has brought the Lewinsky case to an end and has dropped any plans to indict Mr. Clinton.
As part of the deal Mr. Clinton will accept the suspension of his law license in Arkansas for five years.
