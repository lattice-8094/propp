The summit is coinciding with more unrest in several areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians stormed the Israeli-controlled section of Hebron, breaking a curfew imposed since the outbreak of the unrest last month.
Witnesses said Israeli soldiers fired live ammunition and rubber-coated metal bullets, wounding at least seven people.
Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched in the area to protest against a renewal of contacts with Israel.
