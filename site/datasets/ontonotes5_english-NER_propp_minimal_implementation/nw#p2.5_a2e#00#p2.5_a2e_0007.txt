Like Hezbollah, which is leading the sit-down in the streets in Lebanon, Hamas called its supporters to go to the streets after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas-LRB-Abu Mazen-RRB-resolved the debate the Palestinian front has faced over the past months on the formation of the national unity government and his legal authority, by calling for presidential and legislative elections to be held when the elections central committee is technically ready for such elections.
Azzam Al Ahmed, the head of the Fatah faction in the legislative council, said he expected that this would not happen for several months in a statement to " Asharq Alawsat. "
But Abu Mazen left the door slightly open for the possibility of forming the unity government.
This declaration came in a long speech.
Hamas rejected Abu Mazen's decision, and 3 other Palestinian factions in Damascus rejected it as well : the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Islamic Jihad Movement, and the Popular Front-General Command, in addition to Farouk Al Kaddoumi, the Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Fatah Movement, led by Abu Mazen, because of disagreements between the two men.
" I was so saddened to see Al Kaddoumi with them, " Al Ahmed said, commenting on Al Kaddoumi's participation in the press conference which included these fronts in Damascus.
" It grieves me that it reached this level. "
In this atmosphere of tension, Gaza witnessed armed confrontations between the two sides, which led to at least 15 Palestinians being injured,
and things are expected to escalate.
