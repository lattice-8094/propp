Israeli Prime Minster Ehud Barak says he will not sign any peace deal that gives the Palestinians sovereignty over Jerusalem's revered Temple Mount.
Mr. Barak also stressed his government will never accept an accord that gives Palestinians the right to return to Israel.
At the same time Palestinians are saying they will not sign a peace deal with Israel that fails to give them sovereignty over all of Arab East Jerusalem or allow the return of refugees.
Meanwhile, the White House is urging the Palestinians and Israelis to accept the ideas laid out by President Clinton for reaching a final peace agreement.
