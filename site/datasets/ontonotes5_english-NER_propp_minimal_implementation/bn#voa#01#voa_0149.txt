International aid agencies have warned that proposed United Nations sanctions against Afghanistan's Taliban authorities could paralyze efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to the victims of drought and conflict.
The new sanctions proposed by the United States and Russia would impose an arms embargo on the Taliban.
Among other things, they would also freeze Taliban assets abroad and restrict foreign travel by Taliban officials.
The UN Co-ordinator for Afghanistan said in Geneva, the proposed UN measure could block badly-needed aid shipments.
