Two American professors will share this year's Noble Prize in Economics.
They are James Heckman of the University of Chicago and Daniel Mcfedden of the University of California, Berkeley.
NPR's John Edsty reports.
The Nobel Committee said the two were awarded the prize for their work in micro-econometrics, which combined economics and statistics.
As friends and colleagues, Heckman and Mcfedden developed and exchanged ideas over a period of 30 years.
According to Mcfedden, their work is closely related and the common theme is the use of economic theory to study individual behaviour.
Heckmann is best known for labour force studies, including how married women decide whether to work.
Mcfedden has created models aimed at figuring out how people make life's big choices, like when to get married and how many children to have.
Mcfedden says, he will use his half of the 915,000 dollar prize to support his farm in Northern California's wine country.
Heckman is currently travelling in Brazil.
