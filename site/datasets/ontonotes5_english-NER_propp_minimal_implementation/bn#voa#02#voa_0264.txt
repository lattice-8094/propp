Thank you very much, Tony.
The United States and Britain are calling on Libya to accept responsibility for the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
They are also calling on Libya to compensate families of those who perished.
In Washington President Bush said nothing can change the suffering and loss caused by the December 1988 attack on Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 people, but he welcomed Wednesday's guilty verdict for one of the two Libyan agents accused in the bombing.
Correspondent Scot Bob reports from our Middle East bureau Libyan dissidents are hailing the verdict while the Libyan government says it will appeal.
A spokesman from the Libyan Foreign Ministry told state television his government accepts the verdict but that it will be appealed.
The official noted Libya's co-operation in handing over the two suspects and called for the immediate lifting of sanctions.
A Libyan dissident exiled in Egypt Mohammed Fias Jabrel says he is satisfied with the verdict because it proves Libya has committed crimes against innocent people but Mr. Jabrel says he hopes the case is not closed.
I hope that the investigations would continue to bring the real murderers which is of the League of Col. Gaddafi.
He is responsible of the act.
That act will not displace that he did not order it.
270 people died in the 1988 bombing over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
Libya initially refused to hand over the two suspects but it surrendered them nearly two years ago on condition they be tried in a country other than Britain or the United States.
