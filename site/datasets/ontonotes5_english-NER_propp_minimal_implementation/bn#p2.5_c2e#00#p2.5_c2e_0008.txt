The Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision recently conducted a random inspection of the quality of plastic cutting boards.
The result shows, um, nearly 40 % of plastic cutting boards products may contain harmful substances.
The random quality inspection of this time mainly involved the thirteen batches of plastic wrap for food packaging and cutting boards manufactured by twelve companies in Zhejiang Province.
The pass rate of the random inspection is 61.5 %.
A total of five batches of the products failed to pass, of which three batches are plastic cutting boards.
The main existing problem is that the residue after evaporation exceeds the limit.
According to the information, the residue after evaporation refers to the chemical substances possibly produced by plastic products when coming into contact with water, vinegar, oil, and other liquids during use.
These chemical substances are often harmful to the human body.
Some individual production enterprises add excessive amounts of talc, calcium carbonate, and other substances into their products in order to increase the hardness of the plastic cutting boards.
This is the main reason resulting in the failure of these products to pass.
Experts suggest that when shopping for a plastic cutting board, choose the plastic cutting board that is evenly colored and has no impurities or pungent smell.
In addition, during use, it is best not to use it to cut very hot food because high temperature will accelerate the decomposition of harmful chemical substances so that they will enter the food and affect people's health.
