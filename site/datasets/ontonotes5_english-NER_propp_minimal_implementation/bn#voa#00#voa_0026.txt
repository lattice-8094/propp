One other Major League baseball manager is now looking for a new team to lead.
The Toronto Blue Jays have decided not to renew the contract of Jim Firgossy after the team placed third in the American League Eastern Division for two straight seasons.
Toronto finished with the mediocre 83 and 79 record and Firgossy's contract expired at the end of the season.
