There are fears in Israel of a renewed suicide bombing campaign following a suicide bicycle attack against an Israeli military post in the Gaza Strip.
The suicide bomber blew himself up Thursday as his bicycle reached a concrete barrier at the Israeli post.
An Israeli soldier was slightly hurt.
The Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for the bombing and said in a statement it would continue the suicide attacks.
