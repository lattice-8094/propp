New violence was reported in the West Bank and Gaza today, in spite of the U.S.-brokered cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinians.
The clashes took place as Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority reaffirmed its commitment to the truce.
Israel is to withdraw its forces from several areas over the next two days, and an Israeli official says his country would honor the cease-fire even if sporadic rock-throwing continues.
