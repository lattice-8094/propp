From BBC News in London, I'm James Kowling for The World.
It's a day of accusation and counter-accusation amid widespread violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The worst clashes took place between Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank towns of Ramallah and Nabulas.
Palestinian leaders are accusing the Israelis of embarking on a killing rampage.
The Israelis in turn are accusing the Palestinian leadership of failing to meet today's deadline for ending the violence.
John Line has more.
Just as the cease-fire was supposed to be taking hold, some of the most brutal clashes erupted.
In the West Bank town of Nabulas, Palestinian demonstrators were involved in what was a relatively routine demonstration.
Suddenly gunfire broke out.
It's not clear who started it.
As the demonstrators scattered there was a prolonged gunfight, and this evening Israeli helicopter gun ships have used their machine guns in a confrontation near the town of Bethlehem.
Amidst this tension, a busload of Israeli soldiers apparently took a wrong turning into a Palestinian area in the West Bank town of Tukaram.
The Israelis say Palestinian police opened fire causing a number of injuries.
