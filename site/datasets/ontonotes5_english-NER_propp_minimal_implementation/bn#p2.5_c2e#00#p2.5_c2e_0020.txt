The recently concluded China-Africa Forum reminded many people of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway which China offered support in building in Africa.
However, people may not know that today another group of Chinese people in a foreign land are still evoking the same kind of touching story, treating the war wounds of battle-scarred Cambodia, and paving a road to prosperity.
The restoration project for Highway 7 from Kracheh, Cambodia, to the Cambodia-Laos border is China's largest project aiding Cambodia to date.
It is being undertaken by China's Shanghai Construction Group.
Previously on this 186-kilometer road, the widest section was only four meters, while the narrowest was only 40 centimeters.
The road was bumpy and rough throughout, and there were landmines left from the chaos of war back then.
Since construction started on November 18, 2004, through the hard work of Chinese engineers, the width of all road sections has now been broadened to over seven meters.
The first layer of asphalt has been laid and pressed on most road sections, with all lanes expected to be open to traffic by July 2007.
In order to turn this small path into a thoroughfare, the Chinese engineering personnel have overcome a series of difficulties.
