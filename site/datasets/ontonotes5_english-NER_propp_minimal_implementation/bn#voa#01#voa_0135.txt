Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has reiterated Baghdad's strong opposition to the resumption of UN weapons inspections.
Wrapping up a two-day visit in Moscow, Mr. Aziz added that Baghdad is still considering talks with the United Nations on the issue.
Earlier this week, UN officials in New York said Secretary General Kofi Annan would be meeting with Iraqi officials in early January.
