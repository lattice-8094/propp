There are now new progresses in the investigation of murder of former Russian agent Litvinenko.
German investigators said that there were other people in this case, eh, who were also poisoned.
Ah, this person is Russian businessman Kovtun, who is now being treated in a Moscow hospital.
He may be the person who had committed the crime.
The German authorities have also launched an investigation, and, eh, have also found residue of polonium in many places in Hamburg.
German investigators found residue of polonium in the homes of Kovtun's former wife and mother-in-law, but emphasized that this would not pose any danger to the local people.
The workers respectively found traces of polonium in a car used to transport Kovtun, on a document he submitted to the German Immigration Bureau, and on the sofa in his ex-wife's home.
German inspection officers said Kovtun flew to Hamburg from Moscow on October 28.
On the night of October 31, he visited his ex-wife's residence, then flew to London from Hamburg on November 1, and met Litvinenko on the same day.
But no traces of polonium were found in the affected aircrafts.
Litvinenko died of polonium poisoning on November 23.
According to reports, Kovtun had also been poisoned and is now being treated in a Moscow hospital.
German inspectors have a preliminary suspicion that Kovtun may not be just a victim, but may also be the one who had committed the crime, and was suspected of handling polonium illegally in Moscow.
Authorities have already begun investigations.
Some sources say that Russian inspectors may travel to London to conduct investigations.
Litvinenko's family and those who have once been in contact with him said on Sunday that if the authorities could guarantee their safety, they might agree to meet with the Russians.
