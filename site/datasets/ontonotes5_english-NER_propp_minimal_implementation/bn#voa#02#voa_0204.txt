Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called on the Palestinians to accept the US peace proposals.
At a cabinet meeting Mr. Barak warned of increased violence if the Palestinians reject the proposals.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat said Sunday he needs more clarification from Washington.
Mr. Erekat said that the delay in accepting the plan does not amount to a rejection of it.
