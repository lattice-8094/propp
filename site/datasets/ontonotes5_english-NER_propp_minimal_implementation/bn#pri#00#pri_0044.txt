From BBC News in London, I'm Gregor Cragy for The World.
Israeli helicopters have attacked buildings used by Palestinian officials only hours after the Prime Minister Ehud Barak told parliament he believes peace is still possible in the Middle East.
The helicopters reportedly fired missiles at offices of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's ` Fatah movement '.
Israeli officials say there are no casualties and little damage.
Earlier Barak said peace could still be achieved but only if certain conditions are met.
If violence is reduced and a fact finding American led committee go to work, we will be ready to go there and help put an end to violence.
The chief Palestinian negotiator Syeb Arakat said Barak's speech was aimed at forming a coalition with Israel's right wing and would have a negative effect on the peace process.
