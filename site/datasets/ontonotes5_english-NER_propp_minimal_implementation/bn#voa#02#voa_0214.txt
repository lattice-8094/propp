Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Spilanovic says his government will cooperate with the UN War Crimes Tribunal that indicted former President Slobodan Milosevic for crimes against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
He said Thursday in Washington Belgrade would fulfill its duties and responsibilities to the Hague Court, which took the action against Mr. Milosevic in 1999.
