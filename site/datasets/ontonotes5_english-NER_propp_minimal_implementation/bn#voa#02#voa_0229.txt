Israel and the Palestinians have resumed high level peace talks.
The two sides met into the early hours Friday at the crossing between the Gaza Strip and Israel.
Israeli officials say Israel is still hopeful that a framework peace agreement can be reached before the unofficial deadline, the end of President Clinton's term in office on January 20th.
