Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is proposing to transfer to the Palestinians another 10 % of the West Bank and to recognize a Palestinian state under a possible future extended interim accord.
Palestinian officials are rejecting the offer saying it does not meet their main concerns over Jerusalem and refugees.
Correspondent Eve Connan in Jerusalem reports the violence in the Middle East continues as Mr. Barak and other politicians begin preparing for early elections.
Prime Minister Barak, offering an unusually detailed description of his peace plan, said Thursday he would recognize an independent Palestinian state, but would postpone negotiating the issue of control over Jerusalem.
Mr. Barak is hoping to hammer out a peace deal with the Palestinians before facing early elections two years into what should have been his four-year term.
He suggested that if no accord was reached on Jerusalem, Palestinians should be granted 10 % of the West Bank under an interim agreement, but the Palestinians are seeking a permanent peace deal that would grant them independence and East Jerusalem as their capital.
Mr. Barak told a news conference he is not trying to speed up peace negotiations in order to win re-election, but that he will not delay efforts to end the violence.
