Thank you Steve.
Reformist allies of Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica have scored a solid victory in Serbian parliamentary elections.
The Democratic Opposition of Serbia, which supports the President, has claimed about 23rd of the vote.
Mr. Kostunica said in a speech broadcast this morning, that the election victory will allow reforms to move swiftly to start building a democratic government and a free market economy.
Ousted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party and his allies won about 15th of the vote in Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic.
