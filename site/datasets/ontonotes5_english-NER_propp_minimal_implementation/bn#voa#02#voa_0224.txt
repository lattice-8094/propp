In the West Bank Sunday, a 20-year-old Palestinian woman was shot dead while driving on a road leading to Jewish settlements near Nablus.
She was the second Palestinian woman killed by Israeli forces in two days.
Meanwhile Israeli security services charged Sunday that a Jordanian prisoner suspected in a bus bombing in Netanya last month had been recruited by the Palestinian security services.
A Palestinian spokesman called that charge a fabrication.
