South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun is currently on a formal three-day visit to Indonesia.
He is expected to meet with the Indonesian president and discuss bilateral cooperation projects on nuclear energy, petroleum, and natural gas.
South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun is expected to sign a cooperation agreement on nuclear energy with Indonesian President Yudhoyono on Monday, December 4.
Nuclear power generation occupies an important position in South Korea, while the petroleum and liquefied gas that South Korea uses rely entirely on imports.
At present there are 20 nuclear power stations in South Korea, supplying 40 percent of the nation's electricity source.
As an OPEC member state, Indonesia is now actively pushing for energy diversity and has started to emphasize nuclear power generation as an alternative.
South Korea is a major consumer for Indonesia's liquefied gas, but Indonesia recently said it would reduce the exports of liquefied natural gas so as to meet domestic energy needs.
The leaders of the two countries are expected to discuss bilateral cooperation relationships on nuclear energy, petroleum, and natural gas and to sign mutually beneficial agreements on tourism, forestry, anti-bribery, and other fields.
Yudhoyono originally planned to visit Seoul in July, but because of the tense situation caused by North Korea's nuclear bomb test, his visit to South Korea had been postponed.
