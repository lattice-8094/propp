Israel has experienced its fifth suicide bombing in three days.
Police say a bomber blew herself up outside a northern Israel shopping center when she was stopped by a security guard.
Three people plus the bomber were killed, and at least 30 others were hurt.
The French Press Agency says the militant group `` Islamic Jihad '' is claiming responsibility.
