The Sharia Courts in Somalia announced that they are at war with Ethiopia, while fighting intensified between their forces and forces loyal to the government for the third day in a row.
This increased fears of a destructive war erupting in the Horn of Africa region.
Furthermore, the commander of government forces Ibrahim Batari said that battles in the Edale region are becoming increasingly violent, and that there are many corpses on the battlefield.
At the same time, Ibrahim Bilal, commander of the Sharia Courts forces, said that there were heavy losses on both sides, amid bloody days experienced in Somalia, as fighters of both the Sharia Courts and the government forces exchange artillery fire.
The Sharia Courts said that they are at war with Ethiopia, which maintains that it sent hundreds of soldiers on training missions, denying its role in fighting against the Sharia Courts.
The continued battles with rockets and guns increased fears of a destructive war spreading to the Horn of Africa and drawing in regional countries.
Head of the Courts, Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, blamed Ethiopia for the eruption of fighting, describing the position of his forces as self-defensive.
On the other hand, a spokesman for the Ethiopian Ministry of Information said that what Aweys has stated are merely unfounded claims to mislead international opinion.
The Somali government, however, did not comment on these statements and Ethiopia maintained official silence on the declaration of war.
It also denied sending fighting troops into Somalia, and vowed to inform the world if it wanted to attack the Sharia Courts.
