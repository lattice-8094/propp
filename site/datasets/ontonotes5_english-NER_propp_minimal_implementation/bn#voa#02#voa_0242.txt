Masked gunmen have shot and killed the Director of Palestinian Television at a hotel in Gaza Strip.
The motive for the murder and the identity of the attackers are still unknown.
Ross Dunn reports from Jerusalem.
Three hooded men murdered Hisha Mickey, the Director of the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation.
Witnesses say that the gunmen fired into Mr. Mickey's head and heart outside the Gaza Beach hotel before fleeing the area.
The cold-blooded slaying of one of the most prominent people in Palestinian society has shocked residents of the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
Mr. Mickey aged 54 was known to be close to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and a member of the powerful Fateh faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr. Mickey, who had been meeting friends shortly before the shooting, was pronounced dead upon his arrival at a nearby hospital.
He was a father of seven and had served as the Director of Palestinian Television since its inception in 1994 and later founded the Palestinian satellite channel.
