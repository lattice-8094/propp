Arab leaders hold a summit tomorrow in Cairo to discuss the continuing violence between Israelis and Palestinians.
Today was the deadline Israel had set for a truce but it was one of the deadliest days of fighting in two weeks.
At least 9 Palestinians were killed in skirmishes in the West Bank.
At the United Nations, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan says the level of violence is still too high.
Linda Bascilla reports from the UN.
Kofi Annan played a major role in bringing about the emergency summit earlier this week in Egypt, and now after briefing the UN Security Council on his efforts, he made it clear that while violence has decreased some it is nowhere near the level which he thinks is satisfactory.
The UN chief also said that tensions were still high and that the next 48 to 72 hours would be crucial.
He expressed hope that both Israelis and Palestinians would stick to the Sharm el-Sheikh agreement and continue to implement it.
Meanwhile, Annan also told reporters that he hoped the UN General Assembly would send a conciliatory message to both sides encouraging them to implement the agreement.
