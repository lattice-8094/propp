Slobodan Milosevic is back in the public eye.
Today, the former Yugoslav President made his first public appearance since losing power.
Milosevic addressed a special meeting of the Socialist Party of Serbia in Belgrade.
He denounced the democratic Yugoslav government that unseated him, calling the election a coup.
He also accused the West of trying to break up the country.
