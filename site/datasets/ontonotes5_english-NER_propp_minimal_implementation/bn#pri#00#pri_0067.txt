Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said today that he is willing to hold early elections and the decision comes as Barak's popularity is sinking in the polls after two months of violent conflict with Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
The government is expected to negotiate a date for the elections in talks with the opposition over the next few days.
The opposition has recommended that elections be set for May.
The elections would mean that Barak's current term in office would end about two years ahead of schedule.
