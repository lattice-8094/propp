UN Secretary General Kofi Annan says the AIDS epidemic that has killed an estimated 14 million people in Africa, is a test of leadership on the continent.
Mr. Annan told the conference of African leaders in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia that the spread of HIV AIDS can be halted and future generations must be protected from contracting the virus.
