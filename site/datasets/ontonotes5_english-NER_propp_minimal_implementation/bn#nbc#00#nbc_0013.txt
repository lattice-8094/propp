Meanwhile, the director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, is headed for Yemen to personally supervise the investigation into the attack on the `` USS Cole, '' and some progress is being made.
NBC's Jim Miklaszewski is at the Pentagon tonight, with the latest for us now.
Tom, investigators tonight are still trying to figure out exactly what kind of explosive could cause such devastating damage to the `` Cole. ''
They 're focusing on an abandoned apartment where bomb-making materials were found, but today, the Yemen President claims that the explosive found could only come from the U.S. or Israel, implying that the materials or the weapon itself were Western-made.
U.S. military and intelligence officials can not confirm his claim.
Authorities also discovered two Yemen passports, but quickly determined they were fakes, not surprising to one U.S. official, who said everything in Yemen's terrorist underground is a forgery.
Tom ?
Thanks very much, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon tonight.
