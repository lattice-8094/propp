I want to thank the President for Spain's diplomatic support before the conflict,-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-and for the use of Spanish air space and bases as the war grew closer.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
I also offer my condolences to the family and friends of the two members of the Spanish media who lost their lives while covering the hostilities.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Both Spain and the United States are committed to a stable, democratic and peaceful future for the people of Iraq.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Spain has shown that commitment by sending engineering and medical units to help the people of Iraq.

Today, I have moved to ease sanctions imposed by the United States against Iraq's old government.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
First based on the authority recently given to me by Congress I'm suspending the Iraq's Sanctions Act, which restricts the export of certain commitment necessary for Iraq's reconstruction.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Secondly,'m directing the Secretary to relax sanctions on American countries and citizens conducting business in Iraq that contributed to humanitarian reconstruction.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Soon, at the U.N. Security Council, the United States, Great Britain and Spain will introduce a new resolution to lift the sanctions imposed by the United Nations.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
The regime that the sanctions were directed against no longer rules Iraq.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
And no country in good conscience can support using sanctions to hold back the hopes of the Iraqi people.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Across the globe, Spain and America will continue as strong allys in the war against terror.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Today, the United States took steps to cut off financing for the organization because of its ties to the ETA.

We believe that the people of Spain like everywhere have a right to live free from terror.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
We 'll also work for a better world beyond the war on terror.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
We 're committed to expanding trade which builds prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
We 'll work together to address global poverty in the terrible diseases such as HIV AIDS.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Spain and the United States will stand on the side of people everywhere striving for greater freedom, tolerance and opportunity.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
We 're determined to help build peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Last week's confirmation of Mazen permitted the road map for peace, developed with Russia, the European Union and the United States.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
Spain and the United States are determined to take advantage of this moment of opportunity for peace.
-LRB-translator speaking-RRB-
