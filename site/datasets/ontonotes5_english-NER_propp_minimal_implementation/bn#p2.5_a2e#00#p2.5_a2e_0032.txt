Several days after the armed confrontations between supporters of the Fatah and Hamas movements and the multiple violations of the truce, Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh expressed the movement's readiness to begin a dialogue to form a government according to Palestinian premises and conditions, in order to contain the confrontations in the Palestinian street.
Uh, what is required, uh, also is dialogue, and if we can achieve a Palestinian understanding about a national unity government, this is the preferred option.
But it's necessary to deal earnestly with this subject, so that it will in the end lead clearly to the basis of an agreement for a government that is capable of resolving the Palestinian siege.
It is noteworthy that the state of cautious calm prevailing over the West Bank and the Strip comes after violent confrontations that the city of Nablus saw today, which left nine citizens injured, after which President Mahmoud Abbas ordered the deployment of the security forces in the streets of the city to cordon it off.
In the absence of any political internal, uh, Palestinian, uh accord, the situation of internal tension will remain open to the likelihood of infighting even more than what we have already seen, in the next period.
And any political escalation also, uh, uh, is likely to fuel the internal situation which is going towards infighting, as we saw in Gaza and as we saw in the West Bank, particularly, uh, uh, in Nablus.
Meanwhile, the Factions Coordination Committee intervened to release those kidnapped from both sides with the goal of preserving the announced pacification that was agreed upon by leaders of the two factions.
Whereas Hamas sees a solution to the crisis in resuming the national unity dialogues, Fatah for its part sees early elections as the only alternative, and the Palestinian street remains waiting for any practical steps to end the crisis.
