Israeli and Palestinian negotiators met with President Clinton at the White House Wednesday and pledged to continue working toward a comprehensive peace agreement.
US mediated talks resumed this week in Washington.
Correspondent Deborah Tate reports.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat met with Mr. Clinton for about forty-five minutes and exchanged views on how best to move this stalled peace process forward.
Emerging from the meeting Mr. Ben-Ami sounded an upbeat note.
The reflections of the President were very helpful and we are going to get back now to the negotiating table.
But Mr. Erekat was more subdued.
We are facing major difficulties and serious differences.
Mr. Erekat and Mr. Ben-Ami said Mr. Clinton, who has one month left in office, expressed his willingness to host a summit with Israeli and Palestinian leaders but only if such a meeting results in a deal.
