The U.S. Ambassador to Yemen is safe after a plane hijacking in Yemen.
A man claiming to be an Iraqi supporter of President Saddam Hussein hijacked the flight with 91 passengers on board, demanding to be flown to Baghdad.
The pilot managed to land the plane in Djibouti, where most of the passengers got off, including the ambassador.
Witnesses say the hijacker was then overpowered by the crew and taken into custody.
