Russia's lower house of parliament has overwhelmingly approved restoring the former Soviet anthem as the Russian national anthem.
The move had the strong support of Russian President Vladimir Putin who said use of the old anthem represented a gesture of reconciliation.
Critics argued that the anthem is a throwback to the former totalitarian government.
The anthem will have new words, eliminating verses that praised Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.
The lower house of parliament also gave formal endorsement to Russia's white, red and blue flag but reinstated the old red and gold Soviet flag as the flag of the military.
