Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he is freezing tens of millions of dollars in tax payments to the Palestinian Authority as outside efforts to stop the Israeli-Palestinian violence continue.
Prime Minister Barak said late Thursday, he is withholding the money until the Palestinians abide by previous agreements with the Israelis.
Mr. Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat held separate talks Thursday with both US envoy Dennis Ross and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
Both urged the Middle East leaders to resume peace talks and to stop the violence that has killed more than 200 Palestinians since late September.
