Thank you very much, Dave.
Israelis and Palestinians have taken steps to end three weeks of violence, but have warned of difficulties as the clashes continue.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he doubts he can count on Palestinians as partners for peace.
Palestinian officials say Israel needs to remove soldiers from the outskirts of Palestinian cities.
The comments were made as Israelis eased travel restrictions on Palestinians as part of their efforts to end the violence by Friday.
There were sporadic clashes in several Palestinian areas Wednesday, but on a much lesser scale than in previous days.
The US State Department said steps were being taken in the right direction following the emergency summit of leaders earlier this week in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.
Israeli and Palestinian representatives traded charges Wednesday in the first phase of an emergency United Nations General Assembly session on the violence in the Mid East.
VOA correspondent Breck Ardery reports from the United Nations.
The chief Palestinian observer to the United Nations, Nasir Al-Kidwa, told the assembly that Israel has broken occupying and colonial power in Palestinian lands.
Mr. Al-Kidwa said Israel uses savage force against Palestinians and then blames the victims for the violence, but Israeli UN Ambassador Yehud Lancry said the Palestinian Authority is helping to promote the violence by allowing extremists to appear on its radio and television broadcasts.
Mr. Lancry denied Israel has used excessive force saying it has simply protected its citizens.
The Assembly will resume its discussion of Mid East violence on Friday after receiving a report from UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Mr. Annan will review the effect of efforts earlier this week at Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt to end the violence.
