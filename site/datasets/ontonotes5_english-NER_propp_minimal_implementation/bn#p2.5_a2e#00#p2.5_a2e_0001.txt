Lebanese President Emile Lahoud demanded that the opposition voices who are calling for the overthrow of the Lebanese government demand the formation of a national unity government instead.
Lahoud maintained in an interview with the Abu Dhabi Channel, that he is the president of all the Lebanese, is entrusted with the constitution and that democracy in Lebanon is based on agreement, and in order to resolve the current crisis, the cabinet has to be based on agreement.
A president of the republic in Lebanon has to be always the president of all the Lebanese, and this is what I have done ever since I was an army commander.
The president of the republic is, ah, entrusted with the constitution,
and the constitution is clear.
The constitution says in its preamble, that there is no legitimate authority unless co-existence is present in the national charter.
You have to know why this was done in the constitution.
As you know Lebanon is an agreement-based democracy.
Now if all the ministers from a certain group representing approximately a third of Lebanon say that we do not want to take part in this cabinet anymore, this means that the legitimacy of the cabinet is null and void,
and on this basis, what I say, is that before things deteriorate--and they should not, and we will not let them deteriorate--there has to be an agreement-based cabinet, national for all the Lebanese, so they resolve all issues, ah, especially after this war which Israel launched on Lebanon.
Therefore I say that the only solution for us, is not to talk about overthrowing the government, but rather talk about forming a national government.
