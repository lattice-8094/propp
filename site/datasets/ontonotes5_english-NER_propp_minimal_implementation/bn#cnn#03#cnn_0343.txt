The FBI's interest in this state park in Maryland dates back to last December.
Officials got a tip back then that someone may have dumped equipment into one of the park's ponds.

We 've got rather public statements by law enforcement officials saying that he is the suspect that they think he's the guy and then we have denial and then we have this stuff.
It's really--really extraordinary.
Reporter :
Well, the Attorney General has been the only person that has even mentioned Steven Hatfield's name publicly and he called him a person of interest, not a suspect.
But--
