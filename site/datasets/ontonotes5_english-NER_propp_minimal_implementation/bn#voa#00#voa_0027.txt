UN Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed to Israel and the Palestinians Tuesday to get back to the bargaining table.
Mr. Annan met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, then told reporters the region has suffered enough.
It is not an issue just for Prime Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat.
It is not an issue even for the idea of a role.
It is for all of us.
The population have a role to play, the Palestinian and Israeli to work together to bring these things down.
We all have a responsibility.
Among the other diplomatic contacts Tuesday, both sides met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and European Union Security Chief Javier Solana.
Mr. Barak also spoke Tuesday night with President Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac.
