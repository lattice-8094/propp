The Secretary General of the Iraqi Red Crescent, Mazen Abdallah, declared to Agence France Presse that six persons out of the 30, who were kidnapped at noon today from the office of his organization in Al-Karrada in downtown Baghdad, have been released.
He said that " The six were all older in age and worked as guards or drivers in the Red Crescent office in Al-Karrada, and they were released near the region of Al-Shaab shortly after the kidnapping operation. "
He added that " 24 persons remain kidnapped, among them 21 employees of the Red Crescent office and three citizens who came to the office to receive aid. "
Nada Doumani, spokesperson for the Red Crescent in Amman, had earlier confirmed the kidnapping of 25 employees of the Red Crescent.
Security sources confirmed that the kidnapping operation took place at noon today.
These sources said that 50 armed men dressed in Iraqi police uniforms and riding in ten 4 wheel drive cars surrounded the building of the Iraqi Red Crescent, then stormed it and led the men away, leaving the women.
Close to 1,000 employees work at the Iraqi Red Crescent, which is considered one of the few humanitarian organizations still effectively operating in Iraq, through a network of 2,000 volunteers.
About 50 Iraqi merchants were kidnapped last Thursday in the Al-Sanak area in downtown Baghdad, of whom 29 were later released.
