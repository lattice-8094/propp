Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak says he is freezing tens of millions of dollars in tax payments to the Palestinian Authority.
Mr. Barak says he is withholding the money until the Palestinians abide by cease-fire agreements.
Earlier Thursday Mr. Barak ruled out an early resumption of peace talks, even with the United States acting as intermediary.
Eve Conette reports from Jerusalem.
Defending what he calls his policy of restraint, Prime Minister Barak says if Israel thought that 2000 Palestinian deaths instead of the 200 now would really solve the situation, we would act in that direction, but Mr. Barak told Israeli Radio, using greater force would lead Israel into a much more complicated situation.
The Israeli Prime Minister says he, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Bill Clinton are not close to holding a 3-way Middle East peace summit, but he said negotiations should continue if there is a decrease in violence.
His comments came hours after Israeli helicopters attacked offices of Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement.
A German doctor living in the West Bank town of Beit Jala was killed when a rocket fired by Israeli forces hit his home.
