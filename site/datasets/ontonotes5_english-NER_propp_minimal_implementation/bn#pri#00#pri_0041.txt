The United Nations World Food Program, WFP, says up to a million people in Afghanistan could die of starvation unless it receives more aid from donors.
The country has been hit by its worst drought in 30 years.

The World Food Program says its stocks of food aid are due to run out in February, months before the next harvest in June.
Donations of wheat for Afghanistan have traditionally come from western governments.
WFP blames general donor fatigue for their inadequate response, but is pleading for donors to give more food aid for Afghanistan or face a catastrophe.
Conditions in many parts of the country are at crisis point.
Many families have already sold their livestock and household goods to buy food, and still have only 1 or 2 months of starvation rations left.
