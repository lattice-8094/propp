Welcome to another hour of news and information on The Voice of America.

In what diplomats call a historic move, the United Nations General Assembly, Tuesday approved a resolution which was jointly sponsored by the governments of North Korea and South Korea.
VOA's Breck Ardery reports from the UN.
The resolution hails last June's summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas and encourages the two sides to lay a solid foundation for the peaceful reunification of Korea.
The resolution was a collaboration involving North Korean Ambassador Li Hyong Chow and Ambassador Sung Chul Yang of South Korea and was co-sponsored by more than 150 other nations.
Support for the resolution was so overwhelming, it was adopted by consensus without a vote.
Ambassador Sung told reporters the resolution was truly historic because it changes the United Nations from an arena of confrontation on Korea to one of co-operation.
In a sense, the reintroduction of the Korean issue to the United Nations signifies a crucially important turn-around of the history in the relationship between South Korea and North Korea.
In other words, this is a new and fresh start toward genuine peace on the Korean Peninsula.
In a statement on the resolution, the North Korean government said the General Assembly's action indicates firm support of all member states for peace, security, and reunification of Korea.
On the subject of reunification, South Korean Ambassador Sung said that while it is something to aspire to, reunification will probably take years to achieve.
