Last year and this year, the U. N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention twice reached unanimity regarding the issue of Saddam's trial.
The conclusion was that the forcible deprivation of Saddam's liberty contravened the provisions of Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The covenant is a binding international treaty of which both the US and Iraq are signatory states.
The statements said that the opinion issued by the working group on September 1 of this year concretely set out many procedural shortcomings in Saddam's trial.
These included the lack of independence and impartiality of the tribunal, the insufficient time and facilities Saddam had to prepare his defense, the restrictions on his right to access lawyers, also the restrictions on the possibilitly of defense lawyers in calling and interrogating witnesses, and so on.
This working group also emphasized that in issuing the statement it was not requesting the release of Saddam, but rather was recommending that Iraq and US, in accordance with the relevant international covenants, reexamine whether at the outset Saddam's trial conformed to regulations.
Besides the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, these covenants also include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The working group also called on the Iraqi government to refrain from carrying out the sentence of death by hanging on Saddam until it had reexamined the trial procedures.
Saddam is accused of carrying out a reprisal operation against local villagers and killing 143 people in the local area in 1982 after escaping an assassination in the village of Dujail.
On the 5th of this month, he was sentenced to death by hanging by the Iraqi High Tribunal.
Even though Saddam still has the right to appeal to the appellate court, once the sentence has been determined it must be carried out within thirty days.
