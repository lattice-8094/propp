Israel's Deputy Defense Minister Ifraem Snae held talks in the Gaza Strip Thursday with a top Palestinian official.
Mr. Snae's meeting with Tayab Abdul Rahim came hours after the Israeli Army ordered Palestinians to leave joint security liaison offices.
There are no details on the talks.
The two men met at the Eric's Crossing where a gun battle earlier in the day left one Israeli soldier dead.
A second Israeli soldier died in an explosion at a Palestinian-Israeli liaison office near a Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip.
