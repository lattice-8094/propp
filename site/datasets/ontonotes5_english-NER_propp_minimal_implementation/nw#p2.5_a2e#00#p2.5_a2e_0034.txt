British Prime Minister Tony Blair yesterday ignited an already fiery controversy on religious tolerance and cultural conformity in the United Kingdom, when he said that it was the duty of all immigrants to integrate into British society.
He was speaking in front of invitees to his office at 10 Downing Street in London and said, " The immigrant's right to live within a multicultural society is always balanced by his duty to integrate, to be part of Britain, to be Asian British, black British, or white British. "
He added that " Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and people of other faiths have the full right to maintain their identity and their religion, to practice the traditions of their faith and to adhere to their culture.
" This is exactly what we mean when we describe Britain as a multicultural and multi-faith society. "
He defended his government's call to open a debate on extremism after the London bombings in 2005, in order to determine the motives of the Muslim youth in executing such attacks.
He stated that extremism " is not confined to Muslims, as experience has taught us in Northern Ireland and from some elements in ethnic communities. "
" So when we speak about combating extremism, we do not mean the whole Muslim community, but elements of it. "
He explained that, " Extremism is not a problem for British people of Hindu, African, Caribbean, Chinese, or Polish origins.
It is also not considered a problem related to the majority of the Muslim community, because that majority is law-abiding and is proud to be Muslim of British nationality.
It is a problem with a minority of that community, particularly those originating from certain countries, " which he did not name.
