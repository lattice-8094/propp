On the thirteenth, the European Parliament passed new automobile emissions standards--the Euro 5 and Euro 6 Standards.
This means that the European Union will further increase restrictions on vehicle emissions, especially the emission of dust particles and nitrogen oxide.
Automobile exhaust has become one of the main sources of urban air pollution.
In order to improve the air quality in all Europe's cities, the European Union--having put the Euro 4 emission standards into effect on January 1, 2005--has now drafted the stricter Euro 5 and Euro 6 Emission Standards.
The Euro 5 and Euro 6 Emission Standards significantly increase dust-particle and nitrogen-oxide emission requirements for cars and buses.
Under the Euro 5 Emission Standards, particle emissions for diesel cars will be reduced by eighteen percent.
And once the Euro 6 Standards have been put into effect, nitrogen-oxide emissions for diesel cars will have been reduced sixty-eight percent from the present.
The Euro 5 Standards require that from September 2009 all diesel cars sold in Europe be fitted with particle filters.
Current existing diesel vehicles can have the alterations done before January 2011.
The Euro 6 Standards will come into effect in 2014.
