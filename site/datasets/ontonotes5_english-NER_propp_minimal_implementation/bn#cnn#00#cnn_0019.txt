Nine people were injured in Gaza when gunmen opened fire on an Israeli bus.
The passengers were off-duty Israeli security workers.
Witnesses say the shots came from the Palestinian international airport.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak closed down the two-year-old airport in response to the incident.
Palestinians criticized the move.
They regard the airport as a symbol of emerging statehood.
