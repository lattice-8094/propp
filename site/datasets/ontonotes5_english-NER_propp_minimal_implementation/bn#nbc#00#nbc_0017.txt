From the Middle East tonight there's word from Yemen that security has been beefed up around the hotel where Americans investigating the attack on the `` USS Cole '' are staying because of a truck bomb threat.
This as the Pentagon said today that the military is reviewing force protection measures worldwide in the wake of that incident involving the `` Cole. ''
A spokesman said today that security for U.S. troops is a concern not just in the Middle East but everywhere, including here in the United States.
