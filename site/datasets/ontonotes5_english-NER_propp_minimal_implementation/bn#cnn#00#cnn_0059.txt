A Russian Navy spokesman says bad weather could complicate the work to recover bodies from the sunken nuclear submarine `` Kursk. ''
Russian and Norwegian divers successfully removed a rubber coating between the inner and outer hulls of sub yesterday.
Thick fog, rain and high winds are limiting visibility at the site.
All 118 people on board the `` Kursk '' died when the submarine exploded and sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
