Nato led peacekeepers have urged Yugoslav authorities and ethnic-Albanian militants to keep talking to prevent a new round of fighting near Kosovo.
The tension began last week with ethnic-Albanian rebels attacking Serb positions in the Presovo valley of Serbia killing four Serb policemen.
The new democratic government of President Vladimir Kostunica agreed to give the alliance more time before launching counter attacks to drive out the rebels.
Mr. Kostunica visited the valley Monday and pledged to bring peace to the area.
