Two Southwest Airline pilots were reportedly fired for stripping down.
It was n't part of a security check.
`` USA Today '' says the pilots were dismissed for allegedly taking off all or most of their clothes in the cockpit.
I want to make that distinction there.
The pilots are calling the incident a misunderstanding and appealing their termination.
