After counting eighty percent of the votes, the Venezuelan people reelected President Hugo Chavez for a third six-year term, after he led, with sixty-one percent of the votes, his competitor Manuel Rosales, who received thirty-eight percent, in the presidential elections in Venezuela.
Amid cheers of thousands of his supporters, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced his overwhelming victory in the presidential elections, and this according to the preliminary results released by the National Elections Council.
The leftist Chavez won a new six-year presidential term over his democratic socialist competitor Manuel Rosales by receiving more than sixty-one percent of the votes, versus thirty-eight percent for his competitor.
The opposition candidate Rosales, whose supporters counted on him to defeat Chavez, admitted his defeat, but he promised to continue the battle.
The opposition filed numerous complaints about fraudulent activities in previous elections that took place under Chavez's presidency, and that were impossibile to prove, according to international election monitoring organizations.
The Venezuelan opposition also adopted over the past few years a long series of procedures that did not have a big effect on public opinion or political life in Venezuela, like the coup it executed in the year 2002, and a several-month strike in the petroleum sector, which had a negative effect on the economy and led to performing a referendum to remove the President in the year 2004.
But Chavez was able to survive all these events, and turned them into points in his favor.
Chavez, who is considered the fourth leftist to win in Latin American elections over the last five weeks, achieved a big victory in the presidential elections that took place between the years 1998 and 2000.
His victory by a strong majority will grant a clear mandate to remove restrictions on presidential terms and to establish a single party that he is expected to lead in power for decades.
