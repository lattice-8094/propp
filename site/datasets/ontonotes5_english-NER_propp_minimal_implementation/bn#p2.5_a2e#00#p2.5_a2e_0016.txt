Welcome to you ah once again.
Moving to the American situation, and two days before the resignation of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld from his position, he presented a confidential memo to the White House in which he indicated that the American strategy in Iraq is not achieving results, and he requested a clear change in Washington's attitude toward Baghdad.
The New York Times acquired a copy of this memo and wrote the headline, Rumsfeld Demands Changing Policy in Iraq.
Washington should use limited force in any military intervention, and it should redeploy its troops in Iraq to work as a deterrence force when necessary ;
It is necessary to stop sending supplies and financial aid to the Iraqi districts where violence is erupting, in accordance with the policy of reward and punishment.
And the American bases should be merged to total five by next July.
In the memo, Rumsfeld sees the necessity for Washington to work on winning over the Iraqi spiritual leaders and strengthening the infrastructure of Iraq.
He considered federalism of least importance.
In Newsweek, Fareed Zakaria reported in his column on the situation in Afghanistan, and warned of the dangers of Afghanistan turning into a new Iraq.
The headline was Afghanistan Could Be the Next Iraq.
