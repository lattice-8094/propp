Fiji's military commander Bainimarama, who launched a coup on the 5th, held a swear-in ceremony today in the capital Suva, appointing Jona, who has no political background, to be the prime minister of the interim government.
On the same day, Bainimarama declared a national state of emergency and ordered all military reservists back to the barracks.
Bainimarama said that the appointment of Senilagakali as prime minister of the interim government conforms to the relevant provision of Fiji's constitution.
The main duty of a prime minister is to assist the dissolution of the parliament.
At the same time, Bainimarama declared a national state of emergency.
He said that currently the Fijian military has completely taken over the government and the parliament, and is in control of the entire country.
A military committee of the military government will be responsible for administration of state affairs.
The nature of the military government is transitional, and its goal is to lead the country to positive administration, expose corruption and evil doings, and increase the benefits of the people as soon as possible.
The communique also said that the military government will impose curfew if necessary, calling on the Fijian people to give support and exercise patience.
In addition, according to a report by Fiji's TV station Legend FM, Qarase and his wife Leba had been taken from their residence before dawn on the 6th and flown by charter plane to his hometown, Lau Province, the outlying northeast province in Fiji.
Exactly the day before, Qarase still insisted that he was the legitimate leader of Fiji and that many people still supported him.
