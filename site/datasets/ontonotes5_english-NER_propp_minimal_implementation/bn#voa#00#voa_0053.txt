Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has issued an order confining all military and police to their barracks.
The President is locked in a power struggle with former intelligence service chief Vladimiro Monticenos.
Mr. Fujimori told reporters late Wednesday, he ordered a complete freeze on movements by the Armed Forces.
President Fujimori has been leading a purge of the military of those loyal to Mr. Monticenos, the former spy master, whose surprise return to Peru on Monday triggered speculation of a possible coup.
