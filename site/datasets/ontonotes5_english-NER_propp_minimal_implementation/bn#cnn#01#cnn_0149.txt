Al Gore wo n't be the next U.S. President, but he has a slim chance of becoming the next President at Harvard.
Gore holds a degree from the university, and is one of about 500 people nominated for the job.
A school official talked about the Vice President's chances during an interview with `` the Boston Globe. ''
He says it's unlikely Gore will be selected, because he does n't have enough experience in the academic world.
