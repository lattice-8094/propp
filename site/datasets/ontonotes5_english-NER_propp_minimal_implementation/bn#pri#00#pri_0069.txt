In Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been declared the winner in last Sunday's controversial presidential election.
NPR's Jerry Hadden reports.
Former President Aristide won with 92 percent of the vote according to Haitian election officials.
The sweeping victory was expected since Aristide ran virtually unopposed.
Opposition candidates boycotted the vote citing tainted legislative elections last May.
Aristide was elected President for the first time ten years ago and served just months before a military coup sent him into exile in the United States.
He now faces huge obstacles as Haiti's leader.
His country is the poorest in the hemisphere and much of the world community has shunned him.
On Wednesday UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on his organization to close its mission in Haiti citing the unstable political climate.
Though a spate of pre-election violence kept some Haitians away from the polls on Sunday, the voting itself went relatively smoothly.
