President Clinton has ordered a delay in what would have been the first federal execution in 37 years.
Mr. Clinton granted a six-month reprieve to convicted killer Juan Raul Garza, who was scheduled to die at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.
Mr. Clinton says the time to review racial and geographic disparities in the federal death penalty system.
Garza was convicted in 1993 of operating a drug-smuggling organization, killing one of his associates and ordering the murders of two others.
