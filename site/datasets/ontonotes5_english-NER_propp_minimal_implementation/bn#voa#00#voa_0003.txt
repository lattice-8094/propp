President Clinton urged Congress Monday to approve 435 million dollars to cut the debt of the world's poorest countries.
Mr. Clinton said the money is easily within the US ability to pay.
Now let me remind you, we 're talking here about 15,000 of our budget, to lift the burden of debt around the world for years to come.
We 're talking about giving as many as 33 nations a chance for a new beginning and about doing good works that our different faiths demand of us.
Mr. Clinton was joined by several key republican leaders.
Congress has so far failed to provide the full amount that the White House has sought.
