The Ministry of Education today issued the fifth pre-warning for studying abroad in 2006.
The enrollment of seven private schools in Singapore has been revoked or suspended.
Of these seven schools, the Protection Scheme eligibility of the Oriental School of Business has been revoked by the Consumer Association of Singapore.
In addition, the six private schools--the Protection Scheme eligibility of Singapore Institute of Commerce, Louis Preston Business School, Louis Preston Travel & Tourism Training Center, Singapore's Stansfield College, Lions Club of Singapore-Nanyang, and Froebel School of Education--have been suspended by the Consumer Association of Singapore.
According to the Singaporean regulations, schools whose Protection Scheme eligibility has been revoked or suspended by the Consumer Association shall not be able to enroll foreign students any more or must suspend the enrollment of foreign students.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education especially reminds students going to study abroad and international students recruitment agencies not to choose the above seven schools when applying for studying in Singapore.
When applying to schools, make sure to verify whether their qualifications have been certified by the education office of the Chinese embassy and whether they have obtained the Quality Class certification by SPRING Singapore.
