In a report which will be submitted to Congress today, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office indicates that the major reforms, which China has undertaken since its WTO entry in 2001, have greatly benefited American enterprises and consumers.
However, U.S. trade representative Schwab published an article and pointed out that there is some evidence to indicate that China's reform momentum has been starting to slow down, which is disturbing.
In the report to be submitted to Congress, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said that China's reforms since its WTO entry had provided plenty of benefits for U.S. enterprises and consumers.
However, U.S. officials expressed that the report also pointed out that in areas such as anti-piracy, export subsidies, creating obstacles for American agricultural products, publishing and other services, reforms have either retrogressed, or at least shown signs of slowing down.
In the article published in the Financial Times, Schwab pointed out that the United States had planned to lodge complaints on trade disputes, and also ensured that China honored its international commitments made upon joining WTO.
Schwab said that over the past one year, there are various signs indicating that the momentum of China's economic reform has been starting to slow down, and the voices opposing further implementing market liberalization in China have been intensifying ; the government, particularly the provincial government, has also been enhancing its interventional power in the economy.
But she also acknowledged that over the past five years, China has accomplished tremendous achievements, such as enacting special laws to assist China's trading system in adherence to WTO regulations.
The general bans faced by American companies operating in China are also being progressively reduced, but they still have to cope with regulatory obstacles.
