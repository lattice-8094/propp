The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed its support for the principle of fair geographic representation in the United Nations Security Council, in both its permanent and non-permanent memberships.
It expressed the view that the purpose of developing the Security Council structure should be to strengthen the capabilities of the council to perform its role in an effective way, to achieve the desired objective of the international community in maintaining international peace and security.
This came in the Kingdom's speech before the General Assembly, in the sixty-first session on articles ten and one hundred and eleven, regarding the Security Council's decision on the issue of fair representation in the Security Council, increasing the number of its members and the related issues, which His Royal Highness Prince Mishal Bin Abdallah Bin Abd-al-Aziz, Minister Plenipotentiary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave yesterday before the council.
His Highness said that the Kingdom confirms the extreme importance it places on the Security Council's performance of its role and the full responsibility assigned to it to preserve security and peace in an effective way in all regions of the world.
His Highness said that the Kingdom at the same time expresses its disappointment at the effect of the resolutions and work procedures of the council and its double standard policy, which has prevailed in some of its works, especially those related to some security and peace cases in the Middle East region.
His Highness added that the whole world watched the Israeli assaults on Lebanon and on Palestinian lands in a full-scale war aimed at the deliberate destruction of the infrastructure, and violations of human and national rights that targeted innocent civilians with assassination, detention and torture without any consideration for international agreements and treaties or humanitarian considerations.
