Investors on Wall Street are waiting for the word from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on interest rates.
Greenspan will meet with the Federal Reserve Board policymakers today for the last time this year.

That could mean a rate slash.
Earlier this month, Greenspan suggests cuts could be on the way.
