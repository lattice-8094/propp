Human rights groups are criticizing an agreement between the United Nations and China on human rights co-operation saying it lacks the substance to bring about any real change.
Un Human Rights Chief Mary Robinson signed the agreement with Chinese officials in Beijing on Monday.
Ms. Robinson called it a significant move that brings China closer to ratifying two international rights treaties ; the UN Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, as well as a covenant on political and civil rights.
