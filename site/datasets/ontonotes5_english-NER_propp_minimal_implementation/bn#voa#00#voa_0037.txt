The US Senate has passed the bill allowing food and medicine sales to Cuba potentially easing 40-year-old trade sanctions against the Communist ruled island.
The measure now goes on to President Clinton who said he will sign it.
It allows Cuba to buy food and medicine from the United States for the first time since 1962, but the bill restricts US financing of such sales and also continues a US travel ban to Cuba.
The bill is meant to ease the trade sanctions, but Cuba says, the financial conditions will make it impossible to buy US food.
Cuba's Communist Party officials have vowed not to spend one cent on US goods.
President Fidel Castro Wednesday led a massive protest rally in Havana against the bill's restrictions.
