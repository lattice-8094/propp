Amid a wave of enormous anger and in an atmosphere of sorrow and bewilderment, thousands of people in the town of Al-Is'haqi 110 km north of Baghdad buried the victims of an American helicopter raid on two houses in the town.
There was contradictory news on the number of victims and the reasons for targeting them.
While the American army said that it had killed 20 terrorists including two women in its raid on two houses near Thirthar Lake, a local town official said that there were 32 victims including children and women.
A police officer taking part in recovering the bodies said about 17 people were killed.
Amid this contradictory news, Amer Alwan, the local official for the Al-Is'haqi area, confirmed in a telephone call that the majority of victims were children and women.
He said that " 10 children were removed from under the rubble of the two houses that were completely destroyed. They were located 15 km to the southwest of the town and belonged to two brothers ", indicating that the bodies would be sent for post mortem forensic examination to ascertain the cause of death.
He added that the victims included five women and that the remains of four men were recovered, as well as those of three others later on.
