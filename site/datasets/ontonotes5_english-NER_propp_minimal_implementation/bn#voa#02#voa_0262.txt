The United States and Britain have welcomed Wednesday's conviction of a Libyan defendant for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing that killed 270 people, but they stood firm in demanding that Libya accept responsibility and compensate the victims ' families.
State Department spokesman, Richard Bowcher.
As we 've said all along the government of Libya must take responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials.
That means revealing everything they know about the Lockerbie bombing, paying reparations, a clear declaration acknowledging responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials and clear unambiguous actions which demonstrate the Libyan government understands this responsibility.
But late Wednesday a Libyan Foreign Ministry official said Eee is not to blame for the bombing.
He said and these are his words, `` Libya as a state has no responsibility in this affair. ''
The court in Camp Zeist Holland convicted one of the two Libyan defendants of planting the suitcase bomb which brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
It killed all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground.
