A fire in a Bangladeshi garment factory has left at least 37 people dead and 100 hospitalized.
Most of the deceased were killed in the crush as workers tried to flee the blaze in the four-story building.
Witnesses say the only exit door was on the ground floor, and that it was locked when the fire broke out.
Most of the victims were women and children.
