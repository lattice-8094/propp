A lawyer for one of the two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie Scotland continued to attack the prosecution's case Wednesday.
He called two of its key witnesses liars and argued that their testimony be rejected.
Oran Comito is at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands.
In his fourth day of closing arguments, defense lawyer Bill Taler spent most of his time trying to discredit two key prosecution witnesses.
Edwin Boje made timers for bombs that were sold to Libya and allegedly used to blow up the plane.
Mr. Taler called him a greedy fantasist who wanted to implicate Libya in order to get a huge financial reward from the FBI.
Mr. Taler says Edwin Boje also lied about his dealings with the East German Stazi who he also sold timers to.
Mr. Boje testified that the timers were different but Mr. Taler claims they were exactly the same ones as the Libyans had.
He says the East Germans could have sold them to Palestinian terrorists who then blew up the plane.
Defense lawyers have said all along that it was Palestinians and not their Libyan clients who bombed Pan Am 103.
The other witness Mr. Taler tore into was a Libyan double agent known as Jiaka.
Mr. Taler says Jiaka told lies about his client to his American paymasters, the CIA in order to remain on their payroll and eventually to move to the US.
He had sufficient cunning to produce spectacular but ultimately unverifiable stories to the CIA said Mr. Taler.
In short he is a man who tells lies for a living.
Mr. Taler wants the judges, who also serve as the jury, to reject the men's testimony.
Closing arguments continued Thursday with a lawyer for the second accused expected to make his case.
