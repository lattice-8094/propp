Israel has begun gearing up for new elections.
Representatives from Prime Minister Ehud Barak's Labor Party and the main right-wing opposition Likud Block, met to set a date for the new elections.
Israeli news media report the election could be held as early as May 8th or May 15th, two years after Mr. Barak's landslide victory over his right-wing predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
