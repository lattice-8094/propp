Meredith Bewl reports from Jerusalem.
The Israeli military says Palestinian gunmen at the Khan Younus refugee camp in the southern part of the Gaza Strip opened fire on Israeli forces and the soldiers responded.
Palestinians say Israeli rocket fire hit a police post and killed at least one Palestinian security officer.
At least three other Palestinian policemen were killed in the fierce clashes, which went on for hours.
In the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli soldiers gunned down a Palestinian member of the militant Hamas group as he was standing outside his shop.
Palestinians called the shooting an assassination.
The Israeli Army said it was checking the reports.
The shooting appeared to be the latest in a series of targeted attacks against anti-Israeli militants.
Deputy Defense Minister Irfan Sneh said this week Israel now has a policy of tracking down Palestinians who attack Israelis.
