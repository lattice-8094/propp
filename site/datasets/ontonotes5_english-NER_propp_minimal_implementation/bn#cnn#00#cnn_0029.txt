Two Americans have won this year's Nobel Prize for economics.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is giving the award to James J. Heckman of the University of Chicago and University of California at Berkeley professor Daniel L. McFadden.
The Academy says it's for their theories and methods widely used in analyzing work and living habits.
They will share the prize award of $ 915,000.
The economics prize is the fourth in a week of awards announced by the Nobel Academy.
