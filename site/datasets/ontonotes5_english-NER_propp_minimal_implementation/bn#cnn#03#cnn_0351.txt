A bomb exploded today in a courtroom in southern Yemen, injuring four people, one of them a judge.
A man with a pistol was arrested outside of the courthouse and police say he admits planting the bombs.
It was the same courtroom where a suspected al Qaeda militant got a death sentence last week for killing three American missionaries.
