Welcome to you.
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani arrived in Tehran to hold talks with the Iranian leadership on the situation in Iraq.
It should be mentioned that Talabani's visit to Iran will be the second after Iran pledged to help put an end to the violence in Iraq.
The visit was scheduled earlier, but it was postponed after the closure of Baghdad Airport at the time, as a result of a curfew being imposed which was lifted completely today.
In any case, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad acted in advance of meeting his Iraqi counterpart by calling on the countries in the region to cooperate in driving out foreign forces, affirming the need for vigilance and caution.
Nejad's statements came in an speech he made before a gathering of volunteer forces, or what is known as the Basij forces.
Nejad said that Iran is prepared to rescue America and Britain from the quagmire of Iraq provided that they pledge to rectify their course in the region.
And with the failures which the Americans and their allies in the region and the world have suffered, I tell them that Iran is prepared to help you get out of the state you are in, provided you stop the policy of violence and change your ways, then Iran will be prepared to guide you to the path of survival.
I am saying to the states and governments in the region, that we have to join hands in getting the foreigners out of this region, and we have to keep vigilant and cautious so that none falls into turmoil.
It is time that the American and the British administrations open their ears to hear that their policy of insulting nations has reached its end and that their downfall has begun.
