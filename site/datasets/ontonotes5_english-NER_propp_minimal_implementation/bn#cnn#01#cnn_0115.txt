Judges in the Netherlands are refusing to dismiss charges against one of two defendants in the Lockerbie bombing trial.
The judges have rejected defense arguments that prosecutors failed to link the man to the explosion that brought down Pan Am Flight 103.
The suspect is one of two Libyan nationals charged with planting a bomb on board.
270 people were killed when the plane exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, 12 years ago.
The prosecution rested its case last week after five months of hearings.
