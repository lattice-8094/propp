The UN is warning millions of people face starvation in North Korea unless foreign aid is dramatically increased.
The UN's World Food Program says a whole generation of children is growing up malnourished and others do n't even survive that long.
Clare Dule reports.
North Korea's political climate may be improving, but its economy is on the brink of collapse.
Many of its 22 million citizens face starvation if foreign aid contributions do n't rise significantly next year.
The World Food Program warns that a generation of children are going to grow up malnourished and they are the lucky ones.
Many may not survive at all.
This year's harvest was poorer than at the height of the famine in 1997.
Hit by drought at planting time and typhoons during harvesting, the country will have to rely on serial imports to feed its population.
