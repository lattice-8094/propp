The US-North Korean financial working group has ended its second session of discussions on the issue of financial sanctions.
For the most recent details, we will now connect to Phoenix Satellite TV's reporter in Beijing, Qin Feng.
Hello, Qin Feng.
What was the main topic of discussion for the US-North Korean finance working group today ?
And what results were achieved ?
Yes, Anchorman.
The third day of the Six Party Talks has also ended.
What all sides were focusing on today, eh, was still the bilateral discussions between the US and North Korea on the issue of financial sanctions.
This morning at ten o'clock the two sides of US and North Korea met at the North Korean embassy in Beijing.
And the meeting lasted five hours, ending at around three that afternoon.
Regarding the content of the talks, eh, we speculate, eh, that it was probably on a few particular issues, including among them North Korea's demand that the US end the freeze on its assets in the Banco Delta Asia in Macao.
Besides this, eh, it also wants an end to the freeze on the American assets of eight North Korean companies.
Will the US agree or concede to North Korea's demands ?
We still have no idea about this, but the US could possibly acknowledge that North Korea's twelve million US dollars out of twenty-four million US dollars in the Banco Delta Asia in Macao are legal and do not involve money laundering, weapons proliferation or counterfeiting.
