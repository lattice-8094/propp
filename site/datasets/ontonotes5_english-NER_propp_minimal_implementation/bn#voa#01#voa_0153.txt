President Clinton heads to Northern Ireland late Monday on what may be his final overseas trip before leaving the White House in January.
The President arrives in Belfast late Tuesday, after a stopover in Dublin for talks with Irish President Mary Mckaleese and Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
En route to Belfast, Mr. Clinton will also stop in the Irish border town of Dundalk to deliver a speech.
Mr. Clinton's visit to Northern Ireland will be his third as President.
The President has made the peace process in Northern Ireland a key foreign policy priority.
He supported initiatives that led to the 1998 Good Friday Peace Accord and power sharing governments between Catholics and Protestants.
