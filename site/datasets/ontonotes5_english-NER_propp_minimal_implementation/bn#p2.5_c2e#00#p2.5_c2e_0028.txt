A while ago we talked about the dispute that arose between five overseas students from mainland China and their college because they were not satisfied with the education and the refund procedures at Toronto Polytechnic Institute.
In fact, ah, Chinese overseas students being cheated in Canada is not accidental.
At the beginning of this year, uh, the Ontario Ministry of Education revoked the licenses of five private schools on the grounds of being found to have been falsifying and raising students ' grades at will.
As a result, the admission qualifications of Chinese overseas students who have ever studied at these schools have been revoked.
Recently, uh, it has been again reported in the news that at another private college the students were unable to receive their degree certificates after four years of study.
The Global Chinese Press has published an editorial on this series of events, saying why Chinese overseas students in Canada repeatedly get cheated.
In the editorial, uh, it says there are several reasons.
One is, uh, that not enough attention is paid to the pre-warnings issued by the Chinese Ministry of Education for studying abroad.
Second is that some overseas students and parents lack a rational attitude, stepping onto the risky springboard, even when they know fully well that the schools have problems, but in order to get a visa and quickly emigrate.
Third, uh, is that the information for studying abroad has false and exaggerated elements that seriously mislead students.
What is worth noting is, uh, that the Chinese and English versions of the webpages of many private schools are not the same.
The English versions are relatively a little more honest, but the Chinese versions are given to exaggeration.
Here, ah, we want to give a reminder to those students with dreams of studying abroad : you must think very carefully before you choose your school.
