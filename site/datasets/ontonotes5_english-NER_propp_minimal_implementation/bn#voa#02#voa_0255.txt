Israeli negotiators are heading back to the Egyptian resort of Taba today to resume marathon peace talks with the Palestinians.
The resumption comes two days after Israel suspended all contacts following the killing of two Israelis in the West Bank.
In late night consultations with his senior ministers, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided to resume negotiations after the funerals of the two Israelis.
A statement from Mr. Barak's office said the talks would continue for a few days and would break for Israel's February 6th election.
