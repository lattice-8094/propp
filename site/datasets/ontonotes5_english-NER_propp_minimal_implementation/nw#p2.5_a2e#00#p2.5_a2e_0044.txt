The Office of the Russian Prosecutor General announced today, Monday, that British authorities investigating the death of former Russian agent Alexander Litvinenko have officially asked for the assistance of Russia.
The office said in a statement that it had received an official request from Scotland Yard to assist it in acquiring key information in the investigations that were taking place in Britain.
The statement added that a group of officers from the Department for Combating Terrorism in Scotland Yard were expected to head to Moscow soon.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry stated that Russia had issued entrance visas for experts from Scotland Yard, who were investigating the death of Litvinenko.
Interfax News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying, " We can confirm that the Russian Embassy in London has issued valid entrance visas today for experts from Scotland Yard. "
He added that the actual date of arrival would be agreed upon with the Office of the Prosecutor General.
Litvinenko was killed as a result of radiation poisoning late last month in London.
The British police have been examining photographs taken by security cameras after remains of the radioactive substances were found in three locations in London which Litvinenko had visited.
Litvinenko was known for his strong criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and had been arrested several times.
He fled to Britain with his wife and son in November 2000 and was granted political asylum.
He became a British citizen last month.
The Kremlin was accused of poisoning him shortly before his death, an accusation which Moscow has strongly denied.
