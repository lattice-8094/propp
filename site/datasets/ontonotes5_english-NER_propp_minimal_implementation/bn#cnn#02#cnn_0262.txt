An airport in Key West, Florida, today became the setting of what appeared to be a desperate attempt to enter the U.S. by a Cuban national.
The man was arrested there after authorities say he hijacked a Cuban plane using what was reported to be grenades, ordering the pilots to fly to Florida.
The hijacker got off the plane wearing a jacket that said America across the back, and a small child clinging to his leg.
