Let's go live now to the launch of a rocket.
Atop it a European Mars observetory.
Mars Express, it's called.
Let's watch the launch.
It's a little before midnight there right now.
There it goes.
The Mars Express on its way on a seven-month journey to the red planet, contains really two spacecraft.
An orbiter called Mars Express.
It will operate orbiting the red planet for a couple of years.
It also has a lander known as Beagle Two, named after Charles Darwin which he sailed to the island and went into its bit of fame.
The Beagle Two will sit on the surface of Mars for about six months.
If all goes well, it will dig around, probe around, analize rocks and search for signs of water.
If you find water, you 're very likely to find signs of life.
There you see some animation of what will happen about seven months from now as this tiny little lander dropping off--
The entire spacecraft is about five feet in any direction, not much bigger than a fairly large shipping crate.
Now, it will auguster into the surface of the Red Planet and put those samples into various scientific instruments.
That data will be sent back to the European Space Agency in Germany.
This is the first European mission to Mars.
There have been, of course, several American missions, one Japanese and one by the Soviet Union, and with some very limited success.
Mars is a tough place to explore.
You 'll recall December of 1998, I should say, the Mars Polar Lander had a very unsuccessful conclusion to its flight to the Red Planet, which was part of a disasterous Mars season.
