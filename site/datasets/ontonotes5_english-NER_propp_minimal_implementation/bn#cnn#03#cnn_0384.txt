Let's look now at a potential rising star from the next generation in the sports realm.
The National Basketball Association holds its draft on the 26th of this month.
Ohio high school player, high school, we said, LeBron James, will be the top dog.
Most likely drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers get the first pick because of their status.
James already scored back in a $ 90 million Nike deal.
$ 90 million.
But when basketball fans were asked in a Cnn`` USA Today '' poll just how good James will be, 18 % say he 'll be among the best.
Slim margin.
Most think he 'll be very good.
Another 18 % are convinced he 'll be just average or below.
Skeptical fans.
As for that $ 90 million shoe contract with Nike, it may be a good deal for James.
No doubt about that.
33 % of basketball fans see it as a bad deal for Nike.
They must know something about shoes.
