A survey on hunger finds requests from major cities for food and shelter rose this year, in spite of a healthy economy.
The U.S. Conference of Mayors found requests for food were up 17 % from last year.
Demand for emergency food assistance for families with children rose 16 %, and shelter requests went up 15 %.
Officials expect those trends to continue into next year.
