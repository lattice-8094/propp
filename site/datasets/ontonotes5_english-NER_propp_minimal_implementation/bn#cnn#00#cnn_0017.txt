Students at a middle school in Calaveras County, California, are getting an unwanted lesson in entomology.
Thousands of bees have invaded their campus, making it difficult to eat lunch outside and get to class.
The bees were traced to 60 nearby hives.
The county agriculture commissioner has given the beekeeper until Monday to remove the insects or face fines.
