President Clinton is holding separate meetings with rival political leaders in the Northern Ireland peace process.
The United States helped broker the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, and Mr. Clinton is trying to keep it from unraveling.
Today in Belfast, he meets with Northern Ireland's First Minister David Trimble of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party, as well as Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair is accompanying Mr. Clinton for the talks.
