A new and simple blood test may soon be available to help doctors tell which of their diabetic patients is most likely to develop crippling and life-threatening complications.
VOA's Jessica Berman explains.
Researcher Andrew Levi says scientists have long been puzzled by the question of which diabetics develop complications and why.
We know that the complications are directly related to a couple of things.
One is how long you 've had the diabetes, how well you 've been controlled, but it's clear that people with the same level of control of their glucose, same duration of the diabetes differ dramatically in their susceptibility to these complications that are so devastating.
Dr. Levi says one third of insulin taking patients ends up with kidney failure and 80 % develop blinding eye disease.
Scientists have suspected there must be something different about the genetic make-up of diabetics who develop complications ; and that difference may have to do with haptoglobin, a protein whose function is to mop up blood vessel destroying free radicals.
The free radicals are released when oxygen carrying red blood cells called haemoglobin die.
Andrew Levi says there are three different types of haptoglobin and he and his colleagues at Israel's Technion Institute have found that one type of haptoglobin called Type 1-1 appears protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not.
Researchers at Technion Institute led by Dr. Levi have developed a simple blood test to let doctors and patients know who is most likely to develop diabetic complications.
