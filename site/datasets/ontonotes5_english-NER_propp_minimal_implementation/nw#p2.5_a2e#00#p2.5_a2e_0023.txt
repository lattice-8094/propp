In the midst of the deep and tragic crisis the Middle East is witnessing and which has devastated the existence of many people in the region, and under skies clouded over by fears of an intensification of any crisis in the region, it would seem that there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon.
This new hope draws its momentum from the ceasefire decision announced last week and from the possibility of a meeting being held between President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
There is no doubt that the European Union backs all the efforts made in this context which are aimed at reviving the peace process, which is what the region needs most.
The European Union is in no way prepared to consent to this region, the closest and dearest to its heart, remaining in a state of permanent chaos.
What affects the people of the Middle East affects the Europeans directly and vice versa.
This has always been so and this is the reason this relationship has a distinct and unique style.
Today, I see four challenges which we have to face together : the Arab-Palestinian conflict, the Iranian nuclear issue, the situation in Lebanon and the war in Iraq.
My view of the conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis is not new as I have always considered that this conflict is, in one way or another, at the heart of all the other conflicts.
Perhaps resolving this conflict will not necessarily lead to a resolution of other current regional crises but it will deprive fundamentalist rhetoric of its usual justifications and this would be a big step in its own right.
When the Palestinians manage, tomorrow or after tomorrow, to agree to form a new national unity government, this will constitute an important step towards a solution.
The European Union's reaction will be prompt.
