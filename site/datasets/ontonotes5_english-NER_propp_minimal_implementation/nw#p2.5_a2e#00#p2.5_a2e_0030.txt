Informed sources mentioned that former President Amin Gemayel gave verbal testimony yesterday before Military Investigation Judge Adnan Bulbul on the crime of the assassination of his son, Pierre Gemayel, on last October 21st.
The sources mentioned that Gemayel did not directly accuse any person or agency of assassinating his son, but he outlined political incidents that had taken place in the country that might be one of the reasons for the assassination, or the most important of them.
Judge Bulbul is expected to decide, in the light of Gemayel's testimony, whether he will listen to other family members ' testimonies in the same dossier.
The sources talked about the many pieces of information and data available for the investigation, yet translating them into compelling evidence that would lead to exposing those who committed the crime requires some time.
Sources said that the investigation was still at the stage of interviewing witnesses, and that Judge Bulbul summoned a number of people for a session that he would hold tomorrow in order to hear their testimonies in that regard.
A meeting was held in the house of President Gemayel in Sin Al Feel, which included General Prosecutor of the Cassation, Judge Said Mirza, the Government Commissioner of the Military Tribunal, Judge Jan Fahd, and the Investigation Judge, Ghassan Bulbul.
The judges informed President Gemayel of the latest findings of the investigations into the assassination of Minister Gemayel.
President Gemayel expressed his wish " that the road will be opened, since there is no more need for investigation of the crime scene, especially as this is a time of festivities, in order to facilitate citizen movement in the area, since the martyr Gemayel in his lifetime looked forward to the rise of Lebanon and the need to look to the future. "
It was reported that the judiciary would give instructions for the removal of vehicles from the middle of the street in preparation to reopen it to traffic.
