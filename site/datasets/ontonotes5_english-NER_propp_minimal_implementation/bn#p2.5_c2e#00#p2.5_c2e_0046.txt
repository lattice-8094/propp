Today, the State Cultural Relic Bureau made public the recently revised Provisional List of National World Heritage Sites.
The new list contains thirty-five provisional heritage projects that will be subject to an expert consultative system and developmental inspection and management.
Under the provisions of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, a provisional list of items for inclusion as a world heritage site is a precondition for application to gain world heritage site status.
In 1996, our country submitted the first batch of preliminary lists to the UNESCO World Heritage Center.
Ten years have passed since then.
But in recent years there have been a lot of changes in the international heritage protection domain with regards to regulations on application and approval of world heritage site status.
For this reason, in the revised Provisional List of National World Heritage Sites, some of the previous application items have been integrated together and the new project of industrial heritage has been added, while the relatively fixed administrative method has been broken down.
An expert committee composed of experts familiar with world heritage site protection and management will be responsible for conducting developmental supervision and inspection over the preparation of heritage site projects.
Henceforth, provisional cultural heritage items that are not properly protected could be taken off the list at any time and lose their right to apply.
