Al Gore is spending the Thanksgiving holiday in Washington with his family.
Yesterday, he and his wife, Tipper, made their annual visit to a local food bank.
The Vice President joked whether volunteers ought to recount the boxes of food.
Gore also says he's focusing on building a possible administration, a move he thinks George W. Bush should make as well, in spite of the election uncertainty.
