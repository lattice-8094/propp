Turkish police announced yesterday that a terrorist group consisting of 10 people has been disbanded.
The group included a lawyer who claimed in an interview with an Islamic magazine a year ago that he was the head of the Al-Qaeda organization in Turkey.
The group also included two members of the banned Knights of the Great Islamic Orient Front which claimed responsibility for the Istanbul attacks, including the bombing of a Jewish temple and attacks on the British Consulate and the British HSBC bank in November 2003.
A security source said the police had kept the lawyer, whose name they did not disclose, under surveillance after he gave the press interview and located the remaining members of the network who contacted the lawyer through his email on the internet.
The source disclosed the existence of emails which talked about securing materials to make explosives and bombs and drawings and maps of Turkish oil refineries on the Mediterranean which it is believed were a target for the organization's operations.
The police arrested Syrian Loay Saqa in Diyarbakir in August 2005 on suspicion of being the assistant of Al-Qaeda's former leader in Iraq, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, and Tunisian Malik Sharahil, both accused of plotting to blow up an Israeli tourist ship near the port of Antalya, also on the Mediterranean.
They are currently being tried in Istanbul.
Sharahil, who denied being a member of Al-Qaeda, asked not to be deported to his country on the pretext that he would be sentenced to execution because of his affiliation with the banned Renaissance Party.
The security source said that a computer CD had been found in the Turkish lawyer's house which laboratory tests revealed contained materials that would explode in the event of it being played, and this is the first time Turkish security forces have come across such explosives.
