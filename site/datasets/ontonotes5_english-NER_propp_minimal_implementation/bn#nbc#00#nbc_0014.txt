Tom, U.S. officials tonight are assessing new threats made against American warships in the Middle East.
This latest threat calls for more terrorist bombings like that against the `` USS Cole, '', '' but specifically targets American and Israeli ships in the Suez Canal.
It comes from Egyptian militant Rifai Ahmed Taha, seen here with terrorist Osama Bin Laden in a video tape that threatens attacks on Americans in Yemen released only three weeks before the `` Cole '' is hit.
Why Yemen ?
Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers want to know why U.S. warships refuel in Yemen at all, since it's known as a hotbed of terrorism.
Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni said he made the decision to improve military ties with Yemen and because--the threat conditions in Aden the specific threat conditions were actually better than anywhere else, but a State Department report says in the last two years, there have been 35 significant terrorist incidents in Yemen, and Yemen is one of only four countries in the world where terrorist attacks against Americans have increased--52 %.
It's sort of like the Wild, Wild West.
There is no central authority.
At the same time, the Pentagon launches its own investigation to determine what, if anything, went wrong with security for the `` Cole. ''
We will never have a perfect defense against terrorism, but we need to make our defenses as good as they can be.
But too late for the `` Cole. ''
Tonight, the Navy has finished recovering all remains of the 17 sailors killed in the sneak attack.
Officials here knew about the Bin Laden warning before the `` Cole '' was attacked.
The threat was considered so nonspecific, U.S. warships were not put on a higher state of alert.
Tom ?
Thanks very much, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski tonight.
