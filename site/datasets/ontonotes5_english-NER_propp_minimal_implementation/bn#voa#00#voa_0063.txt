Voters in strife-torn Colombia go to the polls today in local elections in the midst of a wave of violence directed by armed groups of the left and the right against many of the candidates.
VOA's Bill Rodgers has a report from our South American bureau.
Some 23 million Colombians are registered to vote Sunday to elect governors, mayors and other local officials in the South American nation, but the election is taking place in the midst of a rising wave of assassinations, kidnappings and threats against the candidates by leftist guerillas and right-wing paramilitary groups.
Twenty mayoral candidates have been killed and more than 200 kidnapped in recent months.
Election authorities say another 200 politicians withdrew their candidacies after being threatened.
At the same time, these armed groups are reported to have fielded a number of stealth candidates in an effort to expand its control of Colombian territory.
Despite the violence, the government of President Andres Pastrana has refused to suspend Sunday's elections vowing they will take place throughout the country and in a democratic atmosphere.
