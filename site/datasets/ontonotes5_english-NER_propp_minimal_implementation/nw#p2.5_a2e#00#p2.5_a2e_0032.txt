President Najib Mikati proposed setting up a new government " whose goal is cooperation and partnership, and not obstruction and toppling, " one that includes politicians-LRB-...-RRB-and experts in economic affairs-LRB-...-RRB-
One of its tasks is to put down a new election law.
In a statement yesterday he said : " What further dangerous signs need to appear for the parties to the conflict in Lebanon to realize the magnitude of the harm that has been done so far, and which could take a more explosive bent if they do not rectify the situation and return immediately to dialogue, and without any pre-conditions. "
The truth of what we have warned against time after time has been proven right beyond doubt, which is that combat in the streets and mobilization of public opinion in futile battles can only result in more draining of the nation and the people, crushing any hope for economic recovery, further distorting the image of Lebanon abroad, and reaching a point of no return in a conflict with absolutely no end in sight except the destruction of the country on top of everyone in it.
All the parties in Lebanon understand that Lebanon can not be governed by one side or by marginal alliances at the expense of any other side.
It therefore rests on the principle of consensual democracy, and the shared-living agreement is an unavoidable fait accompli.
All of them agreed on the principle of a special tribunal with an international character ; they acknowledged the existence of a crisis of governance and institutions ; and they recognized in principle the need to form a national unity government that constitutes the obvious prelude to a partnership in addressing the accumulating Lebanese crises.
