Opinion polls in Israel show hard-liner Ariel Sharon widening his lead over Prime Minister Ehud Barak as the country's February 6th election draws nearer.
A Jerusalem Post poll shows Mr. Sharon's lead widening to 22 percentage points from 16 points last Friday.
Mr. Barak is facing mounting pressure from within his Labor Party to step aside and let elder statesman Shimon Peres run, but he said Wednesday at a campaign rally that no one dare approach him to drop out of the race.
