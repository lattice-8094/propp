President Clinton says he hopes his talks with the top North Korean envoy here in Washington next week will help promote reconciliation with Pyong Yang.
Mr. Clinton said he also wants to, in his words, explore the possibilities during the meeting with North Korea's Jo Myong Rok.
Speaking at the White House, Friday, the President said he is encouraged by the work done by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
