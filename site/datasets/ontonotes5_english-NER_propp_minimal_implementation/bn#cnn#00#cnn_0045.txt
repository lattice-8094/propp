Violence in the West Bank and Gaza has claimed the lives of eight Palestinians today.
All were shot dead in skirmishes with Israeli soldiers.
The new violence erupted at the end of a 48-hour cease-fire which was designed to pave the way for a resumption of peace talks.
Israel's acting Foreign Minister says his nation is hoping to renew those talks, but Prime Minister Ehud Barak is taking no chances.
Barak says he will proceed with plans to form a national government of emergency.
