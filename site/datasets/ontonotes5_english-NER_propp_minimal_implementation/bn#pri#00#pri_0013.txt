Up to 20 people have been killed in a massacre by Colombian Marxist guerillas.
The tactics are more commonly associated with right-wing paramilitaries, but as Jeremy Mcdermott reports, the guerillas now seem to be adopting them too.
Everybody was watching the Columbia-Paraguay football match when guerillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia or Falk swept into several hamlets in the south-western province of Kalca.
Mirroring the tactics of the right-wing death squads, the Falk arrived in the communities with lists in hand and dragged those they found on the list into the street and executed them.
The paramilitaries have long used the policy of massacres to cut away support for their guerilla enemies.
The guerillas are now adopting the same tactics as the Colombian civil conflict enters its 37th year.
