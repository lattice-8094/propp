Yes, although a wide range of topics will be discussed at this NATO summit, general public attention will be focused on : first, NATO's eastward expansion and its relations with Russia, and second, NATO's strategy in expanding its functions and powers in the 21st century.
Then, this NATO summit, eh, is being held at the doorsteps of Russia, in the capital of Latvia, eh, er, Riga ; this is also the first time that such a summit is being held in an Eastern European country, and that itself is provocative for Moscow.
In order to avoid provoking Russia, eh, the NATO summit may not directly announce the second batch of countries covered in the eastward expansion ; but indeed, Macedonia, Albania, and Azerbaijan, er, even, eh, Ukraine and Georgia, which are in tense relations with Russia, are all listed in the next batch of development.
And NATO hopes to work more closely with Asia-Pacific countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia ; and this makes it more puzzling as to how NATO is defining the scope and breadth of its future global partnership strategies.
Also, in addition to counter-terrorism and peacekeeping, eh, NATO also intended to place resources and energy security, as well as computer networks protection, into its scope of responsibilities in its new 21st century strategies.
This means that in the future, the reasons for NATO's global military actions and other excuses, eh, to intervene in situations will all substantially increase.
NATO's desire and goal to move from regional to global, eh, and from passive defense to active attack is now also becoming increasingly clear and evident.
