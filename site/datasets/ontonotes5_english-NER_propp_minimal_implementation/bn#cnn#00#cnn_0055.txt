Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his Cabinet he would declare a `` time-out '' to re-evaluate the Mideast peace process, in light of recent events.
Still, he says, `` Israel will continue to pursue peace and every path that leads to it. ''
He did not say when the time-out would begin or how long it would last.
