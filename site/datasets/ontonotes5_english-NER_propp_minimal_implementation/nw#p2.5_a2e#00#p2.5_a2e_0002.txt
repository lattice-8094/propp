The last thing a father wants to hear is that his son is not like him. Or that he is less competent. Or that he is his opposite.
But this is what George Bush Sr. heard about George Bush Jr. in Abu Dhabi last week.
After the man delivered his address at the " International Leadership " conference, a lady in the audience stood up and told him : " I represent those who respect America and the Americans, but do not respect the current President or his foreign policy. "
The father tried to defend the policies of the son, but he failed.
He criticized the current policy indirectly when he said that when he launched a war on Iraq, he could have entered Baghdad but did not " because the objective was to liberate Kuwait and not to topple Saddam Hussein. "
In my opinion, the real star of the gathering was not Bush Sr., nor Gerhard Schroeder, the former German Chancellor whom we met and heard in Dubai three years ago when he was still in the Chancellery.
The star of the session was the founder of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, the man who transformed a small country from a few huts and a few languages into an international model in the history of development and growth.
Lee Kuan Yew told me that he found that his country spoke many languages, so he decided that the first step is for people to communicate in one language, so he made English the country's official language.
He said he is now betting on the developing world and the new economies like China, India and Korea.
He added that Singapore is transferring its investments from the major industrial countries to the abovementioned countries.
He said capital follows political stability wherever it is.
And wherever there is no political stability, there is no progress or growth.
