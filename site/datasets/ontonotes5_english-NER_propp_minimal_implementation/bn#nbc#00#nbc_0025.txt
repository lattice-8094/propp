There is other news tonight.
A breakthrough in the investigation of the terrorist attack on the `` USS Cole. ''
More on that from NBC's Jim Miklaszewski at the Pentagon with an NBC News exclusive for us.
Jim ?
Tom, in a major development senior U.S. officials tell NBC News, Yemen authorities are holding two suspects believed directly involved in the attack on the `` USS Cole '' and that at least one of the suspects is `` key to the operation, and talking his head off. ''
U.S. officials report the suspect is providing explicit details how the attack was planned for more than a year then executed with deadly precision, how one safe house and the suicide boat used in the attack were acquired months before the attack, that two other suspects, an explosives expert believed to be Iraqi, and another perhaps a Saudi, supervised the operation then left Aden before the bombing.
The suspect also claims they got help from low-level Yemen officials in forging documents, obtaining vehicles, and concealing their operation, but there's apparently no evidence the Yemen government itself was involved.
Now, despite all of this, sources say the suspect still has n't named those behind the terrorist operation but with this breakthrough, U.S. officials are increasingly confident they 'll soon know who specifically gave the orders to attack the `` Cole. ''
Thank you very much, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, who will be staying on this story for us.
