The Balkan Stability Pact has admitted Yugoslavia as a full member marking Belgrade's return to the international community after years of isolation under ousted President Slobodan Milosevic.
The head of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe Bodo Hombak announced the decision as representatives of member countries met in the Romanian capital Bucharest.
A special envoy of Yugoslavia's new President Vojislav Kostunica reaffirmed his country's commitment to peace in the region.
The Balkan Stability Pact was established last year in response to the Kosovo crisis.
