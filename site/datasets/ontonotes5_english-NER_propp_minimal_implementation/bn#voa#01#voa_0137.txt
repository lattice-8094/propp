The Colombian Army says troops have wiped out a leftist guerilla unit in four days of combat that left 26 rebels dead, most of them teenagers.
The Army's official news agency says the clashes erupted Monday in a mountainous region northeast of Bogota.
Army Commander Orhi Mora, says 32 rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the Farc, were captured.
General Mora says most of the rebels in the unit were between the ages of 14 and 17.
He did not report any Army casualties.
The report has not been independently confirmed.
