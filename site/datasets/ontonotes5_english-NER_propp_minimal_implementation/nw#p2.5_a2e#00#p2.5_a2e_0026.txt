The latest Israeli war on Lebanon last July dealt the economy a deadly blow while it was recovering from a harsh recession that had started after the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Al Hariri in February 2005.
The war negatively affected all economic sectors and the life of every Lebanese, directly or indirectly, undermining the monetary and financial situation in the country and shaking the trust of foreign investors.
It seems that the economic repercussions of this war will keep exhausting Lebanon for a long time, according to a comprehensive study on the case issued by " InfoPro, " a private Lebanese organization for economic research.
The study comes in 200 medium-sized pages.
It is published in English under the title, " The Economic Effect of the July 2006 War and Steps for Recovery. "
It goes beyond providing a comprehensive perspective on the extent of the damage caused to the different economic sectors as a result of the war, to demonstrate practical ways to recovery in each of them, through the treatments proposed for the immediate activation of performance as well as plans to achieve sustained economic recovery.
In terms of its comprehensiveness, the study is considered the first of its kind to be published after the war.
During the days of aggression, and after the end of the violence, economic agencies as well as the public sector announced many estimates of the damages left behind by the war.
Their inconsistency left observers in a state of confusion, when the ambiguity of the general economic scene was surrounded by cloudiness.
