ah, ah, ah, I mean, stay with me Mr. Sa'ada,
ah, ah, Doctor, I mean, ah, how do you respond to such talk ?
He does not have representatives,
ah, how can he be the President of the Republic, ah, without having representatives, ah, and casting doubt on the votes ?
Yes, in fact, Ecuador, this relatively small country does not lack revolutionary traditions and the Ecuadorian people have carried out a number of uprisings, but actually the leadership and the absence of programs is the reason that has led to consecutive frustrations.
Yes.
Ah.
I think that the new president has, ah, I mean, inspiration he can get from the experience of Chavez, and the experience of Bolivia, in relying on the people, and relying on forming a political party and on collaborating and coordinating with revolutionary powers.
Ah.
Yes.
Yes.
There is a communist party and there are other revolutionary powers, and there are popular democratic movements that can all coordinate together and be appointed in future elections.
Of course he will face difficulty now.
Yes, especially as he has no support in the Ecuadorian Congress.
Yes, yes, but this can be compensated for by the street.
The local elections can compensate for it.
Yes.
And it can be compensated for by a government he appoints with the power of the people.
