As for the Iranian problem, eh, Iran's deputy foreign minister Mohammed said on Wednesday that his Ministry would conduct a two-day meeting beginning next Monday, and would discuss the scope of Germany's massacre of Jews during World War II.
The participants consist of 67 researchers from 30 countries, including England and France.
Iranian President Ahmadinejad once said that he could not believe that the Holocaust actually occurred.
But as for Iran's nuclear issue, French Foreign Minister Douste-Blazy said powerful nations should agree on possible sanctions against Iran as soon as possible ; otherwise, the credibility of the United Nations will be damaged.
However, eh, when Iranian Foreign Minister Mottaki visited the International Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague, the Netherlands, he said that possessing nuclear technology is a right that all countries possess.
Iran is opposed to any situation which limits the realization of this right for peaceful purposes.
He also reiterated that sanctions would not be effective.
Iran will continue with its nuclear program, but it does not intend to develop nuclear weapons.
Iran is also ready to negotiate with the international community.
He hopes that negotiating parties of the nuclear issue will be able to return to the previous right track and continue the negotiations.
