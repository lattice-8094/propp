United Nations has restored full membership to Yugoslavia, eight years after it lost its voting rights.
VOA's Breck Ardery reports from the UN.
The General Assembly enthusiastically approved Yugoslavia's membership by acclamation after receiving a positive recommendation Tuesday, from the UN Security Council.
Assembly President Harry Holkerry made the official announcement.
I therefore declare the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia admitted to membership in the United Nation.
The action ends eight years of isolation of Yugoslavia at the United Nations.
When Yugoslavia began breaking up in 1992, the General Assembly stripped the nation of its voting rights and ruled Yugoslavia must reapply for UN membership, but it never did until a few days ago when the new democratically elected President of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica sent a formal request to the United Nations.
US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke said, President Kostunica is to be congratulated.
We congratulate President Kostunica on his leadership in bringing peaceful and democratic change to Yugoslavia.
We congratulate his colleagues in the brave democracy movement that brought the will of the people to power in Belgrade.
President Kostunica has sent a special envoy to the United Nations, Goran Slevonovich, who told the General Assembly the new government in Yugoslavia will work with its neighbors to overcome problems.
To that end, Yugoslavia will be a trustful neighbor and a conscientious member of the international community and will invest its best efforts to promote peace and stability in the region, as well as worldwide.
Mr. Slevonovich also thanked those nations that supported the democratic movement in Yugoslavia in what he called a hard and often uphill battle.
