Hurricane Durian is still leaving more victims and destruction in its path.
The hurricane caused the deaths of around 1200 people in the Philippines and dozens in Vietnam while authorities in the disaster-stricken areas fear an exacerbation of the situation and an increase in the number of victims of the sweeping hurricane.
From here Hurricane Durian swept over southern Vietnam, leaving no less than 37 people dead after killing over 1200 people in the Philippines.
The hurricane was accompanied by winds at a speed of 120 kilometers an hour which pushed the Vietnamese authorities to evacuate 3500 people from different areas.
The authorities fear the toll will be worse in this flat region exposed to the winds.
On the island of Fukio, winds destroyed hundreds of boats moored off the shore, tore the roofs off houses and pulled up electricity poles as well as cutting off some roads.
8000 people were evacuated from Ho Chi Minh City.
In spite of the deaths left in the wake of the hurricane, material losses and the loss of roofs from houses, life quickly returned to the streets of Vietnam where some shops opened and the roads teemed with bicycles, the well-known means of transportation there.
Tropical Hurricane Durian cut off electricity at the beginning and sank over 800 boats along the southern coast of Vietnam until the storm changed course suddenly to head for south-west Vietnam.
The National Search and Rescue Committee said that telephone and electricity lines had been cut off and roads closed because of falling trees in the village of Fong Tao to the east of Ho Chi Minh City.
The number of people affected by the storm in three provinces was at least 50,000.
So in just a few seconds, Hurricane Durian transformed more than one province into ruins and carried away dear ones, leaving behind lakes of water, mud, destruction and sorrow.
