First an update on a long-running air safety investigation a year and a half near an airline crashed near New York's Kennedy Airport there is controversy whether the disaster could have been averted.
265 people died in the November 2001 crash of Flight 587, hard to forget those images, after the pilots lost control of the plane, and the jet's tail fin broke off.
Airbus strongly denies claims it failed to provide sufficient warning, but critics say Airbus should have sounded a stronger alarm after a similar incident occurred in 1997.
That is when American Airlines Flight 903 ran into trouble on a trip from Boston to Miami.
The pilots of that plane forcibly applied their rudder to recover from a stall, and as a result the plane's tail section exceeded its design limits.
Pilots managed to land safely, only after a terrifying ordeal for passengers.

Thanks for being with us.
Can you tell me about the flight five years ago.
What happened to you ?
