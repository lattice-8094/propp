A source at the Afghan Interior Ministry announced that eight people including three foreigners, two of whom were Americans, were killed yesterday in a suicide attack on a US security company in the city of Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
The spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, Zimarai Bashari, said that " five Afghanis and three foreigners were killed " clarifying that they were " all working for the US security company, US Protection and Investigation-LRB-USPI-RRB-".
Local police told Agence France Presse that two Americans were killed in this attack, the third in Kandahar in three days.
Police had said that one of the dead was Nepalese.
Mohammed Afzal, a company employee, told Agence France Presse that a state official in the company was killed in this suicide attack, the third in three days in Kandahar.
Police said that the attack took place outside the offices of the US company USPI.
Mohammed Afzal said a suicide bomber set off an explosive charge he was carrying near company employees outside a building in Kandahar.
Afghanistan has been struck by dozens of suicide attacks, especially in the south, for about three weeks now.
Six people, including two Canadian soldiers from a North Atlantic Alliance-led force, were killed last Monday in a car bomb attack in Kandahar for which the fundamentalist Taliban movement claimed responsibility.
On Sunday, two civilians were killed and 21 others wounded, including three British soldiers, in a suicide car bomb attack followed by " defensive fire " by Atlantic Alliance soldiers, according to the Afghan authorities.
Southern Afghanistan has been the traditional stronghold of the Taliban movement since it was ousted from power in late 2001.
3700 people have been killed in battles or attacks, the majority of them rebels and civilians, in addition to soldiers and Afghan police officers, since the start of this year, a fourfold increase in 2005 according to an official report.
