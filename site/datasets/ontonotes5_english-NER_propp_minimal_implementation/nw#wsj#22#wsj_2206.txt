Ambassador Paul Nitze's statement-LRB-Notable & Quotable, Sept. 20-RRB-, `` If you have a million people working for you, every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year, '' is a pretty negative way of looking at things.
Is n't it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you, every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year ?
Do n't be such a pessimist, Mr. Ambassador.
