In the wake of the application for world natural and cultural heritage status for the Five Great Mountains, seven of our country's biggest Danxia landform regions, including Guangdong's Mt. Danxia and Hunan's Mt. Lang, today once again jointly applied in bundle to the World Heritage Committee for world natural heritage status.
Danxia Landforms is the collective name for red sandrock that through long-term wind erosion has taken various and wonderful Danxia peaks.
The scenic areas participating in the joint application include Mt. Danxia in Guangdong, Mt. Lang in Hunan, Mt. Wanfo, Ziyuan County in Guangzi, Lake Dajin in Fujian, Mt. Longhu in Jiangxi and Fang Cliff in Zhejiang.
According to the joint application proposal, the collective name for the application to the World Heritage Committee is China's Danxia Landforms.
The official document submitted was jointly compiled by the seven Danxia landform regions.
The cost involved in the application was also shouldered jointly by the seven applicants.
At the beginning of 2008, the World Heritage Committee will conduct a comprehensive survey and assessment of scenic areas of heritage site applicants.
Eh, a current trend is that UNESCO, ah, and the World Heritage Center encourage each member country, uh, to make more joint or linked applications.
Because, uh, they also feel, uh, presently, uh, that sometimes single entities may result in too great of a number, so they hope that, eh, similar proposals like this can be joined together as much as possible.
In this way, eh, they can be, eh, made more representative.
