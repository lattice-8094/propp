The United Nations in East Timor has issued the first indictments of suspects in the atrocities committed during the territory's 1999 vote to separate from Indonesia.
Patricia Nunan reports from Jakarta.
A UN spokesman says eleven suspects, including an Indonesian military officer, have been indicted for murder and the forced of civilians in East Timor last year.
Ten members of an anti-independence militia group and the officer from Indonesia's Special Forces, are accused of killing 13 people, that includes the murder of five clergymen, two church workers and an Indonesian journalist in the district of in September 1999.
Of the eleven accused, nine of the suspects are being held by the United Nations in East Timor.
The Indonesian military officer and one other remain at large.
Elements of the Indonesian military are believed to have organized and supported anti-independence militias and have seized control of East Timor after separated from Indonesia in a UN sponsored ballot.
Three weeks of bloodshed followed, in which hundreds died while hundreds of thousands fled their homes or were forced to leave by Indonesian soldiers.
The chaos called for the deployment of international peacekeepers in East Timor, to restore order before full independence expected next year.
Since then United Nations and the Indonesian government have been working together to investigate alleged war crimes committed by troops and militia groups.
UN efforts to bring all suspects to justice have been met.
Just last week the investigation hit a stumbling block, when five Indonesian policemen refused to appear for questioning as witnesses at the Attorney General's office.
Their lawyers argued that they are not legally bound to cooperate with the UN probe.
UN officials hope the Jakarta side of the investigation will resume early in the new year.
