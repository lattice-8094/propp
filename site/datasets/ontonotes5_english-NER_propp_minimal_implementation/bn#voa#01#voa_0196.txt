On the ski slopes Christian Hummer edged fellow Norwegian Biarka Engenvick after a thrilling duel down the stretch of a World Cup Nordic combined ski sprint event in Norway Friday.
Hummer trailed Engenvick by 21 seconds at the start of the 7.5 kilometer cross-country race.
that's because Hummer finished third in the morning jumping portion on Lillehammer's Olympic Hill.
However, Hummer overtook Austrian David Kriner who placed second in the ski jump after about one kilometer.
two kilometers later Hummer approached Engenvick and they skied together the rest of the way.
It was only the second World Cup win for Hummer who's been on the national team for five years.
And that's sports, I am Dave Byrd.
