President Clinton will host a meeting at the White house Saturday with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who are holding talks in Washington.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and lead Palestinian negotiator Sayeeb Erekat are coming to report to the President and to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
On Friday Ms. Albright joined the two negotiators at the peace talks at Bowling Airbase in Washington.
The talks are aimed at putting the peace process back on track after three months of violence.
Mark Rengav, a spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington told VOA, the security of the Israeli state is key to reaching a settlement with the Palestinians.
If Israel is going to offer a substantial compromise, passing over the overwhelming majority of the West Bank and Gaza to full Palestinian control and there will be a Palestinian state next to us, then we have to have an understanding that for such a historic compromise, that it is the end of the conflict, that there are no longer Palestinian claims against Israel and that the two states will be living together in peace.
