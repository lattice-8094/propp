Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will resume peace talks today after a three day delay.
A senior Palestinian negotiator says the session will be a follow-up to the one held Saturday to discuss the set of peace compromises proposed by President Clinton.
Monday Israel cancelled peace talks with the Palestinians and re-imposed a total clamp-down on the Gaza Strip following the abduction and killing of a Jewish settler.
Laurie Cassman reports from Jerusalem.
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has condemned the killing of a Jewish settler in Gaza.
He calls it an unforgivable and abominable crime.
Mr. Barak told the Arabic language Al-Jazeera TV that Israel will punish those who carried out the attack.
Israeli officials have called off their scheduled meeting with Palestinian negotiators to protest the incident.
The meeting was part of the latest effort to narrow differences over a US proposed framework for brokering a final peace deal.
An Israeli spokesman said security talks may still take place but a Palestinian negotiator said no meeting is scheduled.
Israel's military commander for the Gaza region Yayir Nave blamed the Palestinian Authority for not cracking down on such attacks.
Incidents like this, he says, do not happen without support from inside the Palestinian Authority.
Israel has repeatedly called on the Palestinian Authority to curb the violence and take action against those who attack Israelis.
