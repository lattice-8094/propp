An Israeli envoy has met with President Clinton at the White House and has delivered Israel's formal acceptance of US peace proposals.
The envoy Gilead Sher emerged from the meeting late Friday telling reporters the next step in the process is up to President Clinton.
However he said tranquility must be restored in Palestinian territories.
The Israelis have agreed in principle to the parameters President Clinton has laid out but they have expressed some reservations, as have the Palestinians.
