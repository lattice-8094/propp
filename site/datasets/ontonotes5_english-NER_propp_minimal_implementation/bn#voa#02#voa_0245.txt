Israelis and Palestinians could begin a marathon round of peace talks as early as Sunday but Israel has not yet said whether it will take part.
Prime Minister Ehud Barak is postponing until Saturday his government's response to the Palestinian's proposal for talks.
Correspondent Laurie Cassman reports from Jerusalem that Mr. Barak is under pressure to go ahead with the peace effort.
Prime Minister Barak is to meet with his top ministers involved in the peace process on Saturday night to decide what response to give to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's proposal.
The meeting was delayed a day in protest after the brutal killing of an Israeli youth in the West Bank.
The Palestinians have proposed a ten-day non-stop negotiating session to narrow differences over key issues blocking a final peace agreement.
If Israel says yes, the marathon meeting will probably take place in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba just across the border from Israel.
Israeli TV says the Palestinians already are sending an advanced team to Taba to prepare for the meeting.
The talks would come in an awkward moment for Prime Minister Barak who is facing an uphill battle to keep his job.
The latest opinion polls show right wing Likud Party leader Ariel Sharon could easily win the February 6th election.
Prime Minister Barak had hoped for a peace deal to clinch victory.
Ariel Sharon has already said he would not honor Mr. Barak's compromise proposals.
He says his negotiating position with the Palestinians would be much tougher.
Mr. Sharon's peace plan would retain Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
The plan would also cut in half the amount of West Bank land Israel is to turn over to the Palestinians.
Mr. Sharon talks of long term interest talks push for a single final peace settlement.
