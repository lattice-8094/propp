After enduring three days of heavy selling, the beleaguered Nasdaq over-the-counter market finally rebounded, rising sharply in hearty trading.
The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.7 %, or 3.35, to 463.28.
It rose more than the New York Stock Exchange Composite, which improved 0.2 %.
Among bigger stocks, the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 1 %, or 4.56, to 453.05, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 %.
Richard Bruno, head of OTC trading at PaineWebber, said the OTC market has a habit of lagging big moves on the New York Stock Exchange.
While the industrial average rallied on Monday following last Friday's collapse, the OTC market, which did n't suffer too badly during the correction, tumbled.
`` Our market got hit a lot harder on Monday than the listed market, '' Mr. Bruno said.
`` We 're just recovering and getting back to business as usual.
I'm encouraged by the action. ''
The trading pace was busy, with 4,343 issues and 147.6 million shares changing hands.
Advancing issues beat declining ones, 1,271 to 811.
Much of the jockeying by OTC traders and investors centered on shares of companies that might be financially affected by damage from the devastating earthquake in northern California.
As investors speculated about the long-and short-term implications, shares of a number of companies that might either profit or face problems because of the disaster were actively traded.
Heading the list : insurance, construction and technology companies located in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Insurance-related stocks were mixed as investors tried to figure out how to assess the impact of the property damage and deaths on those concerns.
Traders said property-casualty companies with the heaviest exposure in the San Francisco area include the OTC's Safeco and Ohio Casualty.
Frank Gilmartin, a trader who follows insurance stocks for Fox-Pitt Kelton, said his strategy was to sell early.
Then, if the stocks fell sharply, he planned to begin buying them aggressively, on the theory that the companies that insure against property damage and accidents will have to raise rates eventually to compensate for the claims they will pay to earthquake victims and victims of last month's Hurricane Hugo.
As well, reinsurers and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits.
Many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry, which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition.
But Mr. Gilmartin said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts.
`` The companies just gave back what they had reserved for, '' he said.
`` Now, they 'll have to increase their coffers to protect for the future and that means rate increases. ''
Overall OTC insurance issues were mixed.
Safeco fell 18 to 32 58 on 462,900 shares.
Ohio Casualty rose 14 to 51 34 on 137,200 shares.
