Israeli intelligence agents have captured 16 Palestinians believed involved in the mob killings of two Israeli soldiers.
Sources tell CNN the suspects were arrested in the West Bank town of Ramallah and taken back to Israel for trial.
The murdered Israeli soldiers became lost after making a wrong turn.
When Palestinian police took them to a police station in Ramallah, a mob overran the station and killed them, throwing one soldier's body from a window.
