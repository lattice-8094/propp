At the same time tonight, American troops in the Persian Gulf remain on a very high state of alert as U.S. officials continue to worry about what they call a very specific terrorist threat.
The troops are stationed in Bahrain and Qatar across the Arabian peninsula from Yemen, where the `` USS Cole '' was attacked.
NBC's Jim Miklaszewski has the latest from the Pentagon.

Tom, the terrorist plot against Americans throughout the Persian Gulf and Mideast may be much bigger than first feared.
Heavily armed gunboats circle the crippled `` Cole '' in Aden harbor today as U.S. forces dig in against more possible terrorist attacks.
NBC News has learned that U.S. intelligence reports uncover plans for three seperate attacks against American targets in the Persian Gulf and Middle East, specifically a U.S. warship, a military base and an embassy.
In response, U.S. troops in Bahrain and Qatar are put on the highest state of alert--threatcon delta.
Adm. Craig Quigley, Pentagon spokesman : We thought it was simply the prudent thing to do, to go to that higher threat condition in those two specific areas.
American forces at Incirlik in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia are also targeted and on alert tonight.
U.S. embassies in Qatar and Jakarta, Indonesia, thousands of miles away, are closed as a precaution.
Meanwhile, how did the suicide bombers penetrate security on the `` Cole. ''
Raymond Moonie was on the deck and injured in the blast.
I waved on to them because I thought, Hey, they 're friendly.
The entire operation fits the pattern of Osama Bin Laden who had already carried out attacks against American targets.
One senior official is so certain they 'll find the smoking gun that points to Bin Laden, he says they 're already looking at all the options, possible missile strikes or even some military operation to take Bin Laden into custody.

Thanks very much, Jim Miklaszewski tonight.
