It became certain that Turkey's accession to the European Union is not near after the European Commission recommended a partial freezing of the discussions between Ankara and the European Union.
A new blow by the European Union was directed today at Turkish ambitions, seeking to join the other twenty-five members in the Union, with the announcement by the European Commission of a partial freezing of negotiations.
Though Turkey went a long way on the road to join the Union, it has not yet met all the conditions in the view of the Commission.
A decision seeming more like a European punishment for Turkey's refusal to open Turkish ports and airports to Cypriot navigation traffic like the rest of the countries in the union, and according to what the Ankara Protocol stated.
The European Commission confirmed that there will not be any discussions between the Union and Turkey about policy negotiations related to Turkish restrictions on the Republic of Cyprus until the required conditions have been achieved.
In the framework of the latest decision, the Commission decided to freeze negotiations in eight out of an original thirty-five chapters that countries eligible to join the Union should meet.
As soon as the decision was announced, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed his opinion that the commission's recommendation was unacceptable.
This suppressed the hope that emerged yesterday when the Pope supported Turkey for accession to the Union's membership, after he had previously opposed it.
Today, and after traversing much distance on the way to joining, Ankara finds itself again clashing with European justifications and claims that prevent it from reaching its goal.
