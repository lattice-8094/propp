Al-Hayat has learned that Levni informed the French side, during her recent visit to Paris, that Israel will not make moves towards withdrawing from Shebaa Farms prior to a comprehensive peace agreement.
Sources saw Israel as wanting to hold back all its cards in the Lebanon file, including Shebaa, because it does not know how things will develop in Lebanon.
The French side insisted during talks with the Israeli Minister on the need to strengthen Fuad Siniora's government through a political victory by having Israel state its willingness to withdraw from Shebaa, under a Lebanese government that respects the implementation of Security Council resolutions.
However, sources noted that " Israel does not agree to such a step ", saying that " there is a widespread impression among circles informed on Israeli politics that just as Israel wants the current Syrian regime to stay in place-and it proved this in its war on Lebanon last summer-then with the same logic, it is comfortable with a Syrian regime in Lebanon and a government in which Hizbollah is represented but under the control of a specific, known Syrian regime ".
The sources said that Levni did not come up with anything new on the Palestinian front but " reiterated the usual position which says that Israel does a lot, is committed to the ceasefire and self-control and that the head of the Israeli government-LRB-Ehud Olmert-RRB-has extended his hand to the Palestinians.
She also reiterated preconditions to any change, including the need for Palestinians to work towards putting their house in order. "
The sources concluded by saying that " a state of stagnation surrounds all open files concerning the Middle East and the cards that can be played are very few ".
