From Texas politics now to Chinese censorship.
China today blacked out a CNN interview that was critical of the Chinese government's handling of the SARs epidemic and of the country's health care system.
China requires foreign broadcasters to use a Chinese satellite to serve their country.
Until last month it was routinely blocking almost all reports about Sars in China, a practice that has produced intense global criticism.
The British Broadcasting Company has also faced the censorship in China.
In 1993 Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling stake in China's Star TV satellite system.
In 1994 the BBC World Service broadcasts were pulled from Star.
China was offended by the BBC's news content and demanded that STAR TV remove it or lose permission to broadcast in China.
A year later Murdoch bought the rest of Star TV that he did not own.
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. has an extensive presence, of course in this country.
That presence may be expanding soon, if the FCC eases some of its broadcast rules.
Murdoch has lobbied hard for those changes.
They would allow him to buy even more U.S. television stations.
Next month the FCC is likely to accommodate him.
Murdoch today promised that if the rules are changed he will limit future purchases to a few of what he calls sizable markets.
