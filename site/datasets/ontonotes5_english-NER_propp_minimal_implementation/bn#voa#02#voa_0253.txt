Violence has flared in Indian Kashmir as the deadline for the expiration of a government sponsored unilateral ceasefire approaches.
As Anjana Pasricha reports, the renewed violence has cast a shadow on the Indian government's peace initiative.
Defense Minister George Fernandes said Monday the government will decide whether to extend the ceasefire in Kashmir after an in-depth analysis of the situation.
Mr. Fernandes says violence in the region has escalated in the past month.
Sunday, stepped-up violence claimed at least fifteen lives across Kashmir.
Six people were killed and dozens of others injured when a public bus was hit by a landmine blast about thirty kilometers north of Srinagar.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
In other incidents, police said militants set off an explosion outside the office of the ruling National Conference Party in the state's winter capital Jammu, and eight militants were killed in two separate encounters with security forces.
In recent days India, Pakistan and Kashmir's main separatist alliance have traded accusations of jeopardizing the peace initiative.
Kashmir's main political alliance, the All Party's Hurriyat Conference has accused hard liners in the Indian government of trying to sabotage the peace process.
Senior leaders of the group want to travel to Pakistan for talks but the Indian government has not yet granted travel documents for the visit.
Pakistan has accused India of threatening the peace process by refusing to issue travel documents to the Hurrriyat leaders.
Senior Indian officials have accused Pakistan of continuing to train and arm Islamic militants despite the ceasefire.
They have expressed disappointment that the ceasefire has failed to reduce violence in Kashmir.
India declared a ceasefire in Kashmir for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and later extended it for another month.
Kashmir has been hit by a Muslim separatist insurgency since 1989.
