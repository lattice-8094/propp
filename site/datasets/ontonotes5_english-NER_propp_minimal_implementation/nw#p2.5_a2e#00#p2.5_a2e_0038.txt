The Board of Muslim Scholars in Iraq denounced Al-Maliki government's request to the American occupation forces to prolong their stay in Iraq.
The statement, of which Al-Quds Al-Arabi received a copy, added that at a time when Iraqi national forces are seeking to obtain a timetable for the withdrawal of the occupation forces from our country, taking advantage of the political developments on the American scene to take this injustice and despotism away from our people, the present government is seeking once again to grant the occupation a chance to stay on, holding on to its presence for no other reason than to secure guarantees of its remaining in power at the expense of suspending the interests of the Iraqis, their violated sacred sites, and their blood that bleeds like rivers every day.
The statement added that this is an expected step from a government under an oppressive occupation claiming that its presence is necessary to spread security and stability in Iraq and for Iraq to transition to the realm of freedom, democracy and prosperity, of which we continue to hear but see no traces or existence in our land.
This is the fact of the situation in general in our country, particularly the security situation, which has declined throughout the lean years of the occupation to such bad, deteriorating conditions that it can not be hidden from anyone, near or far, so much so that the harbingers of disaster and strife are looming.
This fact clearly leaves those who want the best for Iraq and its people with no alternative but to communicate that bitter painful reality to the world.
The Board went on in its statement that such a step confirms what we have always said : that the political process under occupation will not succeed in bringing sovereignty back to Iraq, because the occupation will remain in control of it.
Neither the government nor the parliament will have an effective will against the will of the occupier, and the members of the government stubbornly refuse to admit this fact, whereas events prove it day after day.
