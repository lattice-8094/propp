Two leading allies of Slobodan Milosevic have resigned their government positions.
The Yugoslav Prime Minister and the Serbian Interior Minister were both seen as key figures in the deposed President's regime.
From Belgrade, Jacky Rowland reports.
It's been a day of further blows for Slobodan Milosevic who only last Friday spoke of plans to rebuild his party and stage a political comeback.
Two of his allies have been forced out of positions in the state apparatus.
Amid applause and laughter in the Serbian parliament, the powerful Interior Minister Vlico Stwilkivich resigned.
His departure will open the way for the new President, Vojislav Kostunica to rein in the police force, which has traditionally been a staunch defender of Mr. Milosevic.
In another development, the Yugoslav Prime Minister Momer Bolatavich has also stepped down.
