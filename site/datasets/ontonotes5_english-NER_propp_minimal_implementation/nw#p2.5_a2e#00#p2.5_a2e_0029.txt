The Arab Water Council is currently looking into the provision of financial funding in order to update studies relating to the financial situation in Arab countries and to prepare regular reports on the Arab water situation and the recommendations needed to face future crises linked to water security.
Cairo was host to the 3rd Regional Arab Water Conference last week, attended by irrigation ministers, the Egyptian Mahmoud Abu Zaid, the Iraqi Abdul Latif Rasheed, the Moroccan Abdulkarim Zahoud and the Sudanese Joseph Joakok, as well as 350 experts from 22 Arab and foreign countries, in the course of which they warned of Arab countries ' increasing reliance on imported food.
Abu Zaid asserted that the time has come to rely on non-governmental organizations and civil society associations to provide suitable conditions to face the challenge of water scarcity and pointed out that one of the priorities of the work of the Arab Water Council is to set up a program funded by eminent Arab sponsors.
Abu Zaid said that the scarcity of water in the region dates back 50 years and continues to increase at a rate in line with the population increase, alongside threats to water resources from rivers shared with neighboring countries and a worsening economic situation in several Arab countries which impedes steps towards development.
He said that the difficult equation in the region is that of achieving food security since food production uses up around 80 % of Arab water resources.
This means that there has to be cooperation in order to make use of the excess in some countries, alongside increased Arab investments in the field mentioned and the creation of cooperation strategies.
The head of the National Center for Water Research in Egypt, Shadin Abduljawad, presented a report to the conference which said that 65 % of our water resources originate from outside the borders of Arab countries and that the percentage of water desalination in the arid Arab region is close to 70 %.
