Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said today he will stop diplomatic contacts with Yasser Arafat until after the Israeli election on February.
Just yesterday, he had agreed to meet with the Palestinian leader this coming week in Sweden.
The announcement triggered harsh words from Arafat at the Davos World Economic Forum, where he spoke with Israeli elder statesman Shimon Peres.
