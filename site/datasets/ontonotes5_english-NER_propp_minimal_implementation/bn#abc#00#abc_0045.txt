American Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross goes to Morocco this week for meetings with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
News of the meeting came the same day Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak resigned.
Barak's dramatic move is considered a tactical one.
After a special election in two months, he hopes to be back in office.
