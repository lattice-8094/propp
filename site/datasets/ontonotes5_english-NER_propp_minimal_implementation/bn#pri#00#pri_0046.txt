Senior Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators are both expected in Washington this week to discuss the situation in the Middle East.
The negotiators are expected to meet separately with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
NPR's Tom Gilton has more.
Israeli and Palestinian leaders are both striking a defiant tone.
Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat is accusing Israel of destroying the peace process, and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak continues to say he wants timeout from the negotiations due to the ongoing violence, but neither leader wants to cut all ties to the peace process.
The State Department says Arafat has agreed to send his senior peace negotiator, Saab Erekat to Washington to meet with Secretary of State Albright before the end of the week.
Albright is also expected to meet the Israeli Foreign Minister Shlama Ben-Ami some time this week, though the Israeli government has not yet confirmed a date for that meeting.
State Department's spokesman Richard Voucher said both meetings will be devoted largely to a discussion of ways to reduce Israeli-Palestinian violence.
