And investigators in Taiwan raise more questions about the disintegration and crash of a China Airlines jet last May.
All 225 people aboard were killed.
A probe has determined the plane had metal fatigue cracks and metal corrosion.
Investigators say the cracks may have been the result of a runway accident 20 years earlier.
