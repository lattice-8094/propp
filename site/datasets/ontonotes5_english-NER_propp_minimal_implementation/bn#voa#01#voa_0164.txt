Israel's parliament has given preliminary approval to legislation allowing former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to run in an upcoming special election.
Under current law Mr. Netanyahu is barred from participating because he's not a Member of Parliament.
Meanwhile, Israeli forces have killed four Palestinian policemen at a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip.
Israeli forces entered the Khan Younus camp after Palestinian gunmen fired at Israeli bulldozers leveling an earthen barrier.
