The Iraqi Drilling Company succeeded, uh, in drilling seventy-five productive wells in the south oil fields, two months before the final delivery date, in addition to continuing to drill a hundred other wells and implementing maintenance operations for a big portion of the wells.
This will, to a great extent, contribute to raising the capacity of Iraq's production of crude oil.
The efforts that engineering and technical cadres and personnel in the Iraqi Drilling Company exerted have been interlinked, through the completion of seventy-five oil producing wells in the south fields, and in two months less time than the determined period.
This achieves oil productivity and adds a new industry for the country.
We delivered such a distinguished work to the Ministry of Oil this year, that is, finishing seventy-five oil wells and at an early time this year, two months before the determined time.
The company is also finishing another hundred wells in Al-Rumela Northern fields, western Al Karna, Al Fakka, after it had achieved progressive achievement rates in establishing the reclamation machines, in addition to treating well problems.
The work has started on another hundred wells that we expect to finish, God willing, before the start of the second half of this year, I mean, in the first half, God willing, they will be ready.
This achievement is a big challenge that reflects the will of the Iraqis with their devotion and loyalty in work.
Each oil well means an increase in Iraq's oil exports abroad.
A series of actions to develop oil fields and a shining point in raising oil exports, this is what the employees in the Drilling Company are devoted to, in order to increase the number of wells and production.
