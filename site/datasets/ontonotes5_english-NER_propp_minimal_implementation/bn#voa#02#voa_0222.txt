President Clinton is sending US mediator Dennis Ross back to the Middle East in yet another effort to make progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians before Mr. Clinton leaves office in two weeks.
A senior White House official said Mr. Ross intends to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
They will discuss the possibilities remaining in Mr. Clinton's term as President.
