South Korean President Kim Dae-jung has accepted his Nobel Peace Prize.
The award recognizes his efforts to end 50 years of bad blood between North and South Korea.
Though the two countries are still technically at war, President Kim, a former dissident, met with his North Korean counterpart in June to move toward reconciliation.
In accepting the Peace Prize, the 75-year-old President pledged to continue fighting for human rights and peace.
