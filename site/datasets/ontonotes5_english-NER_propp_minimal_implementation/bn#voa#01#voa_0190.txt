Democratic reformers are claiming victory in Saturday's parliamentary elections in Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
Mr. Kostunica told Serbian television today that the election victory will allow the reformers to move swiftly to start building a democratic government in what he called a socially oriented market economy.
VOA's Barry Wood reports from Belgrade that the elections come less than three months after Slobodan Milosevic was ousted from power when he lost to a reformer in a presidential election.
Reformist Democratic Opposition of Serbia, the DOS, proclaimed victory only hours after the polls closed.
Unofficial results suggest that the reformist coalition will obtain about 65 % and a clear majority in the 250 seat Serbian Parliament.
The Socialist Party of ousted strong man Slobodan Milosevic, appears to be getting 13 % of the vote and is likely to be the largest single party in the Parliament.
Vote counting continues with official results likely no sooner than late Sunday.
Voter turnout was about 60 % less than had been expected.
Reformist leader Zuan Jinjich, who is said to become Serbia's Prime Minister, called the election a popular mandate for democracy and the free market economy.
He promises to bring Mr. Milosevic to justice and rid the police and judiciary of Milosevic loyalists.
